# IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md

## Purpose
This file supplements `CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTION.md`.

It documents the **current implementation state**, **recent decisions**, and **release-relevant notes**.

It must stay short, precise, and aligned with the actual codebase.

If there is any conflict, `CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTION.md` remains the source of truth.

## Implemented Features

### Camera
- CameraX Preview working reliably
- Back camera only
- Lifecycle-safe preview handling
- Locally bound CameraX use cases are released when the Camera composition is disposed; async provider binding is guarded against late bind after dispose
- Capture and save via MediaStore
- Capture callbacks are protected with ViewModel-issued capture tokens so stale CameraX success/error callbacks after rotation or navigation are ignored before starting the save pipeline
- Stale capture success callbacks recycle the delivered bitmap and do not emit save, compare, navigation, or snackbar side effects
- Capture flash and haptic feedback on capture trigger
- Save failures show user-facing feedback and keep the app usable
- Session-save failures (MediaStore save succeeded, but `SessionStorage.saveSession` returns null) surface a dedicated `capture_saved_compare_failed` Snackbar; `compareInput` remains null and auto-open compare is not triggered; the generic `capture_saved` Snackbar is suppressed in this case
- Camera start/bind failures use a dedicated camera-start error path and invalidate `imageCaptureState`
- CameraScreen bottom workflow is stable: `Reference` / `Capture` / `Compare`
- Compare is always visible and never dynamically switches to Shots/History
- Disabled Compare taps show short workflow hints (~2000 ms)
- Top-right CameraScreen navigation contains persistent History and Overflow actions
- History opens the internal Compare Library even when it is empty
- Overflow contains Settings and About entries

### Settings
- SettingsScreen is implemented and reachable from the CameraScreen top-right Overflow menu
- Settings are persisted locally via DataStore Preferences in `sameview_settings`
- Implemented settings:
  - Grid Type: Off / Rule of Thirds / Quarters
  - Keep screen awake
  - `library_filter`: `"all"` / `"favorites"` (default `"all"`) — added 2026-06-20
  - `library_sort_order`: `"newest_first"` / `"oldest_first"` (default `"newest_first"`) — added 2026-06-20
  - Reset overlay after capture
  - Auto-open compare after capture
  - Recreation Guidance (GPS; boolean; default OFF; lazy permission request)
- Grid Type updates CameraScreen grid rendering through `CameraViewModel` state
- Keep screen awake is applied only while `CameraScreen` is visible and is cleared on dispose
- Reset overlay after capture removes the reference image entirely after a successful capture:
  - `referenceImageUri`, `referenceImageMetadata`, `referenceImageHasViewportMismatch`,
    `referenceImageDisplayMode`, `overlayOffsetX`, `overlayOffsetY`, `overlayScale`,
    `isOverlayNearlyInvisible`, `displayModeChangedByUser`
- `overlayAlpha` and `compareInput` are preserved; compare session remains accessible after reset
- Auto-open compare after capture emits a one-shot navigation event only after successful capture with valid session data
- Auto-open compare does not replay on rotation or recomposition

### Permissions
- Full permission flow implemented:
  - initial request
  - rationale
  - permanent denial -> app settings
- Camera permission is rechecked on `ON_RESUME` after returning from Android Settings
- Returning from Settings does not trigger an automatic permission re-request
- Permanently denied state updates without requiring an app restart

### Location Permission (GPS Recreation)
- ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission flow implemented
- Lazy request: permission is never requested on app start; request is triggered only when the user first enables "Recreation guidance" in Settings
- Pre-rationale dialog shown before the system permission dialog
- On permanent denial: toggle reverts to OFF; inline hint in Settings explains that location access is required
- ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION declared in manifest as companion permission; enables Photo Picker to return unredacted GPS EXIF for HEIC and JPEG reference images
- `setRequireOriginal()` is called only when the URI authority is `media` (Photo Picker); SAF/DocumentProvider URIs are opened directly to avoid SecurityException

### GPS Recreation Guidance

Full specification: `GPS_RECREATION_SYSTEM_V1.md`

Implemented (Blocks 1–8, plus Live direction arrow):

- **Reference GPS EXIF extraction** — passive read from the reference image EXIF via `ReferenceImageMetadataReader`; no permission required; missing GPS is normal and not an error condition
- **Recreation Guidance setting** — boolean DataStore setting (default OFF); parent toggle controlling all GPS behavior, GPS EXIF writing, and metadata.json location fields. A dependent sub-setting **Live direction arrow** controls bearing arrow display; see Live direction arrow entries below.
- **LocationProvider** — `LocationManager`-based; `GPS_PROVIDER` primary, `NETWORK_PROVIDER` fallback; 8–10 s update interval; foreground-only; no `BACKGROUND_LOCATION`
- **GPS activation conditions** — GPS updates are requested only when all four conditions are simultaneously true: Recreation Guidance ON, location permission granted, reference image has GPS EXIF, CameraScreen is active and in the foreground
- **GpsGuidanceState / GuidanceComputer** — sealed interface (`Hidden`, `Neutral`, `Informative`) with proximity color model (Green/Orange/Red/Neutral), Haversine distance, and geographic bearing computation; bearing suppressed below ~15–20 m; hysteresis prevents color flickering; small distance/bearing changes below threshold are filtered. The North-up bearing model has been removed. `bearingDegrees` in `GpsGuidanceState.Informative` carries device-relative bearing when Live direction arrow is ON and the sensor is active; null when Live direction arrow is OFF or distance is below the suppression threshold.
- **GpsGuidanceChip** — Composable on CameraScreen; distance label, proximity color accent, optional device-relative bearing arrow (Canvas, visible when `bearingDegrees != null`); `AnimatedVisibility` fade transitions; does not overlap Top-Left Hint Zone; `Hidden` state renders no element. When Live direction arrow is OFF, chip shows distance and proximity color only (distance-only default). No N-label; no static North-up arrow.
- **Live direction arrow setting** — boolean DataStore setting (`"live_direction_arrow"`, default OFF); sub-toggle under Recreation Guidance; enabled only when Recreation Guidance is ON; stored value preserved when Recreation Guidance is toggled off; does not influence GPS capture, EXIF writing, or `metadata.json` contents.
- **CompassProvider** — `TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR` wrapper (internal `SensorEventListener`, callback-based `Float` azimuth delivery); handles rotation matrix extraction, display-rotation remapping via `SensorManager.remapCoordinateSystem()`, and azimuth normalization to 0–360°; exception-safe; foreground-only; sensor active only when all five conditions are simultaneously true: CameraScreen active, Recreation Guidance ON, Live direction arrow ON, reference image has GPS EXIF, location permission granted.
- **DirectionArrowCalculator** — pure `object`; `computeDisplayBearing(geoBearing, azimuth)` = `(geoBearing - azimuth + 360°) % 360°`; isolated from GuidanceComputer.
- **Smart SAF Fallback** — one-shot dialog offered only when Recreation Guidance is ON and the selected reference image has no readable GPS EXIF; `SAF/OpenDocument` is the fallback path; `onReferenceImageSelectedViaSaf()` never re-triggers the dialog; dialog is not shown on picker cancellation
- **metadata.json schema v3** — schema version updated to 3; `captureLocation` and `referenceLocation` are optional top-level fields; v2 sessions remain fully readable; `SessionScanner` accepts versions 2 and 3
- **GPS capture freeze** — at shutter trigger the current GPS fix is frozen into an immutable `GpsSnapshot`; `gpsSnapshot` is null when Recreation Guidance is OFF or no location fix is available
- **GPS EXIF in MediaStore/gallery image** — written via `GpsExifWriter.writeGpsToUri()` when `gpsSnapshot != null`; fail-soft, never invalidates the saved image
- **GPS EXIF in `capture.jpg`** — written via `GpsExifWriter.writeGpsToFile()` when `gpsSnapshot != null`; fail-soft
- **GPSDateStamp EXIF tag** — written when `fixTimestampMs != null`; UTC date in `YYYY:MM:DD` format (Block 8)
- **GPSTimeStamp EXIF tag** — written when `fixTimestampMs != null`; UTC time as `HH/1,MM/1,SS/1` rational format (Block 8)
- **GPSProcessingMethod EXIF tag** — written as `GPS` when provider is `"gps"`, as `NETWORK` when provider is `"network"`; omitted otherwise (Block 8)
- **`reference.jpg` never receives GPS** — by design; it is a rendered geometry product with no location semantics
- **`reference-original.jpg` GPS preservation** — when Recreation Guidance ON and the reference image has GPS EXIF, those coordinates are re-written from `ReferenceImageMetadata` via `GpsExifWriter`; fail-soft; no GPS is added when guidance is OFF or the source has no GPS
- **`captureLocation` in `metadata.json`** — top-level optional field; written when `gpsSnapshot != null`; fields: `latitude`, `longitude`, optional `altitude`, optional `accuracyMeters`, optional `provider`, optional `fixTimestampMs`
- **`referenceLocation` in `metadata.json`** — top-level optional field; written when Recreation Guidance ON and reference has GPS EXIF; fields: `latitude`, `longitude`, optional `altitude`, `source: "exif"`
- **Recreation Guidance OFF** — `gpsSnapshot` is always null; no GPS EXIF written to any file; no `captureLocation` or `referenceLocation` in `metadata.json`

GPS is architecturally separate from the Compare rendering pipeline. `GpsSnapshot` is not a rendering input. `ReferenceRenderer.render()` receives no GPS data. See `GPS_RECREATION_SYSTEM_V1.md` sections 2 and 6 for the full constraint set.

### Reference Image
- Android Photo Picker integration
- Single image selection
- Picker cancellation does NOT remove existing overlay
- Invalid or unreadable reference images show a Snackbar

### Overlay Rendering
- Overlay displayed above preview using AsyncImage
- Opacity adjustable via slider (0.1-0.9)
- Overlay drag implemented
- Overlay pinch scaling implemented
- Reset restores the default alignment state
- Overlay delete is supported with confirmation and undo flow
- Overlay state is stored in ViewModel and survives normal rotation within the active session
- Live overlay coverage warning shown in top-left hint slot when less than 20 % of the overlay is visible within the viewport; soft warning only, capture always allowed

### Grid
- Grid overlay implemented as a preview-only Canvas layer
- Grid is not written into captured images
- Supported grid types:
  - Off
  - Rule of Thirds
  - Quarters

### Compare
- `CompareScreen` is implemented as a separate fullscreen slider-based comparison screen
- Tap-based fullscreen viewing mode is implemented
- Back exits fullscreen before leaving the screen
- Compare shows a metadata header above the slider: title, location (`📍 displayName · city, country`), or `Created <date>` fallback; hidden in fullscreen (spec: §42)
- Compare image load failures show a fallback UI and allow back navigation
- **Favourite star (2026-06-20):** TopAppBar action (first action before Create Video); visible when `sessionId != null`; outline star = not favourited; filled star with `SameViewStarFavorited` amber tint = favourited; toggles via `CameraViewModel.toggleFavorite()`; state derived from `CameraViewModel.savedSessions` — no local state in CompareScreen
- **CompareScreen TopAppBar — planned restructuring (spec 2026-06-21, not yet implemented):** The dedicated Create Video icon will be replaced by an Export icon (see `SHARE_COMPARISON_IMAGE_V1.md §6` and `COMPARE_FLOW_V1.md §43`). The Export icon opens a dropdown with "Share image" → `ShareComparisonScreen` and "Share video" → `CreateVideoScreen`. This restructuring is part of the Share Comparison Image implementation scope, not yet implemented.

Active compare session lifecycle — fully implemented:

- `compareInput` persists across lifecycle transitions, camera rebinds, capture errors, and CompareScreen navigation
- `compareInput` is cleared by: reference removed, reference replaced, new successful capture, or session deleted
- `deleteSessions` atomically clears `compareInput` when the active session's ID is in the deleted set
- Optional auto-open compare after capture is implemented as a one-shot `UiEvent.NavigateToCompare` and does not change `compareInput` lifecycle rules
- Full spec: COMPARE_FLOW_V1.md sections 14, 38 and 39

### Compare Library
- `CompareLibraryScreen` is implemented as a focused internal session overview
- Sessions are shown in a grid
- Long-press multi-select delete is implemented with confirmation
- Multi-select mode includes Select All / Deselect All toggle and a Backup icon
- Backup exports all selected sessions as a single ZIP file via SAF `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`
- A `LinearProgressIndicator` is shown below the TopAppBar while backup is running; backup and delete icons disabled during this time
- After successful backup: multi-select mode exits automatically, selection is cleared
- After failed backup: multi-select mode remains active, selection is preserved (user can retry)
- Titles and user-authored location are displayed on tiles when present (see tile display logic below)
- Tile text area always reserves height for two lines — grid height is stable regardless of content
- Tile display priority: (A) title + location → title / location, no date; (B) title only → title / date; (C) location only → location / date; (D) neither → date only
- Location is formatted using the §32 priority order: displayName · city, country → displayName · city → displayName · country → displayName → city, country → city → country
- **Favorites (2026-06-20):** Favourite star visible on each tile in normal mode (TopStart, 48 dp touch target, icon anchored to corner); hidden in multi-select mode; toggled via `CameraViewModel.toggleFavorite()` with Write-First and targeted in-memory update; `ScannedSession.isFavorite: Boolean = false` added; `SessionStorage.updateFavorite()` added
- **Filter / Sort (2026-06-20):** Overflow menu (⋮) in normal-mode TopAppBar; Filter: All comparisons / Favorites only; Sort: Newest first / Oldest first; persisted via `SettingsRepository`/DataStore keys `library_filter` and `library_sort_order`; filter then sort pipeline derived in-memory via `remember`; Favorites-specific empty state when filter = Favorites and no favorites present; Select All operates on the **filtered list** only (see PD-08 note above)
- This is not a general gallery or MediaStore browser

### Share Comparison Image

Full specification: `SHARE_COMPARISON_IMAGE_V1.md`
Implementation plan: `implementation_plans/historic/SHARE_COMPARISON_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Status: Specification and implementation plan complete (2026-06-21). Not yet implemented.**

Block A completed (2026-06-21): scope addendum written in `CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTION.md` — Share Comparison Image and Create Video declared in scope as session post-processing export features; capture pipeline restrictions clarified; out-of-scope boundaries (cloud, social media integrations, server) preserved.

Slider handle product decision resolved (2026-06-21): Slider export style includes the SameView handle (see `implementation_plans/historic/SHARE_COMPARISON_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §4`).

Block 1 completed (2026-06-21): CompareScreen TopAppBar restructured — dedicated Create Video icon replaced by Export icon (`Icons.Outlined.Share`); Export dropdown with "Share image" (item 1) and "Share video" (item 2); test tags `compare_screen_export_button`, `compare_screen_export_share_item`, `compare_screen_export_create_video_item`; 5 existing Create Video tests migrated to Export flow; `onShareComparisonImage` no-op placeholder wired in MainActivity; `testDebugUnitTest` PASSED; `assembleDebug` BUILD SUCCESSFUL.

Block 2 completed (2026-06-21): ShareImageRenderer core implemented — package `com.isardomains.sameview.image`; new classes: `ShareComparisonStyle`, `ShareQuality`, `ShareCaptionData`, `ShareRenderConfig` (+ `computeCanvasDimensions`, `buildDisplayName`), `ShareMediaStoreWriter`, `CaptionRenderer`, `SliderRenderStrategy` (50/50 + gradient divider + SameViewAccent handle + white arrows), `SideBySideRenderStrategy`, `ShareImageRenderer` (orchestrator, IS_PENDING lifecycle, no EXIF written); 15/15 unit tests PASSED (`ShareRenderConfigTest`); `testDebugUnitTest` BUILD SUCCESSFUL; `assembleDebug` BUILD SUCCESSFUL; instrumentation tests (`ShareImageRendererInstrumentedTest`) require real device — not yet executed.

Block 3 completed (2026-06-21): `ShareComparisonViewModel`, `ShareComparisonPreview`, `ShareComparisonScreen`, `MainActivity` route + navigation wired.

Block 4 completed (2026-06-21) — **Share Comparison Image fully implemented and verified**:

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL; 611/611 PASSED; ShareRenderConfigTest 15/15, ShareComparisonViewModelTest 20/20, all prior tests remain green
- `connectedDebugAndroidTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL; 594/594 PASSED on SM-S911B (Android 16); ShareImageRendererInstrumentedTest 6/6, ShareComparisonScreenTest 7/7, all prior tests remain green
- `assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `assembleRelease` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- JPEG export confirmed in `Pictures/SameView` on device; MediaStore DISPLAY_NAME format verified; no GPS EXIF; app launches without crash
- Manual smoke tests Smoke-01, 02, 09, 10, 18 deferred — require physical screen interaction before production release

### Video Export

Full specification: `VIDEO_EXPORT_V1.md`
Implementation plan: `implementation_plans/historic/VIDEO_EXPORT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

MP4 export infrastructure implemented and verified (Blocks 1–2 Completed). Create Video flow implemented and verified (Blocks 3+4 Completed). High Quality export implemented and verified (Block 5 Completed). Branding endcard implemented and verified (Block 6 Completed). Block 7 Final Verification completed — manual device smoke test passed on SM-S911B (2026-06-10). Block 9 Flash Mode completed (2026-06-17). All Video Export blocks complete:

- **Renderer Core (Block 1)** — `VideoRenderConfig`, `VideoMode`, `VideoExportFormat`, `VideoQuality` enums; `VideoFrameRenderer` interface; `CompareSliderRenderEngine` (cubic smoothstep, gradient soft-transition divider + 1 px core line, fill semantics); `BeforeAfterRenderEngine` (linear crossfade, fit semantics); canvas setup and bitmap lifecycle; `computeCanvasDimensions` with even-dimension enforcement
- **Encoding Pipeline (Block 2)** — `VideoEncoder` (MediaCodec H.264/AVC, ByteBuffer input, ARGB→YUV420 conversion, NV12/I420 auto-detect via `MediaCodecList`); `MediaStoreVideoWriter` (IS_PENDING lifecycle, `Movies/SameView`, cleanup on failure); `VideoExportPipeline` (orchestrates decode → render → encode → commit; coroutine-cancellation-safe cleanup via `NonCancellable`)
- Output: MP4, H.264, 30 FPS, 7 Mbps, `Movies/SameView`, no audio track
- **Create Video Flow (Block 3+4)** — feature is now fully reachable from the app via CompareScreen
- CompareScreen TopAppBar contains Create Video action with Slideshow icon; TopAppBar structure: Back | Create Video | Delete Session | Overflow
- `CreateVideoScreen` contains three states: Configuring, Rendering, Preview
- Configuring-State: mode selection (Compare Slider / Before & After), format (Original / Portrait / Landscape), duration, quality, branding toggle, Create Video CTA; UI aligned to Settings language using SettingsCard / SettingsSwitchRow / SameViewSegmentControl from `SettingsComponents.kt`
- Rendering-State: CircularProgressIndicator, LinearProgressIndicator, frame progress text; Back opens Cancel Export Dialog
- Preview-State: ExoPlayer/Media3 auto-play, loop, muted; Share as primary action; Done as secondary action; Delete Video as destructive text action with Confirmation Dialog
- Share uses Android Share Sheet via `Intent.ACTION_SEND` with MediaStore-URI; opens only on explicit tap
- Delete Video deletes the MP4 from MediaStore after explicit confirmation; returns to Configuring on success
- Done / Back from Preview closes the screen; video remains saved; returns to CompareScreen
- `brandingEnabled` persists via DataStore `sameview_settings`; Default = true; `BrandingEndcardRenderer` renders a 1.5 s endcard (45 frames: 6 fade-in + 33 static + 6 fade-out) when enabled
- **High Quality + Device Limit Fallback (Block 5)** — High Quality export path is fully wired
- `VideoEncoder` supports H.265/HEVC via new `codecMimeType` parameter; `findHevcEncoder()` and `isResolutionSupported()` added as static helpers
- `VideoExportPipeline.resolveEncoderParams()` selects codec and canvas dimensions before MediaStore insert: HEVC preferred for HIGH_QUALITY (silent AVC fallback if no ByteBuffer-capable HEVC encoder found); resolution checked via `VideoCapabilities.isSizeSupported()`; falls back to Standard 1080p if device cannot handle 4K
- Bitrate: STANDARD_1080P = 7 Mbps (unchanged); HIGH_QUALITY = 20 Mbps
- User-visible Snackbar `create_video_quality_fallback_notice` emitted only when resolution is capped (not on HEVC→AVC codec switch)
- T-U-20 grün; T-I-01/T-I-02 PASSED (`VideoExportPipelineStandardTest`); T-I-03 PASSED (`VideoExportPipelineTest`) on SM-S911B (Android 16)

---

### Session Backup Export

Full specification: `SESSION_BACKUP_EXPORT_V1.md`

- User-initiated, local, full-fidelity backup of one or more compare sessions as a ZIP file
- Written to user-chosen storage via Android Storage Access Framework (`ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`)
- No additional permissions required; no FileProvider required
- No network calls; any cloud destination is handled by the OS SAF provider outside the app process

Entry points:
- `CompareScreen` overflow menu → "Backup Session" (single session; requires `sessionId != null`)
- `CompareLibraryScreen` multi-select action bar → Backup icon (one or more sessions)

ZIP format:
- One subdirectory per session, named by session ID
- File set is metadata-driven: all filenames declared in `files.*` block plus `metadata.json` — v4 sessions export 4 files; v5 sessions export 6 files including `capture-original.jpg` and `reference-source-original.[ext]`
- Files written byte-for-byte without modification (no re-encoding, no EXIF stripping, no GPS stripping)

Operation locks:
- Backup blocked while deletion in progress; deletion blocked while backup in progress
- SAF picker returning null URI → no-op, no snackbar, no state change
- All-or-nothing: any failure aborts the entire backup and attempts best-effort cleanup of the partial file

Feedback:
- Success: "Session backed up" (1 session) or "N sessions backed up" (N ≥ 2)
- Failure: "Backup failed" snackbar; never silent

---

### Session Storage
- Successful captures with an active reference can create an internal session under `filesDir/sessions/<sessionId>/`
- **Session Originals (2026-06-22):** schema is now **v5**. Each new session contains six files: `capture.jpg`, `capture-original.jpg`, `reference.jpg`, `reference-original.jpg`, `reference-source-original.[ext]`, `metadata.json`. Full specification: `SESSION_ORIGINALS_V1.md`.
  - `capture-original.jpg` is a byte-for-byte copy of the committed MediaStore file (quality 95, all EXIF intact)
  - `reference-source-original.[ext]` is a byte-for-byte copy of the reference source URI; extension derived from MIME type (`image/jpeg` → `.jpg`, `image/heic`/`image/heif` → `.heic`, `null`/unknown → `.bin`)
  - Compare uses only `capture.jpg` + `reference.jpg` — originals are provenance files for future HQ export
  - `metadata.json` v5 writes `reference.sourceUri` (correcting the v2–v4 misnomer `reference.sourceDisplayName`); writes `reference.sourceMimeType` when non-null
  - `files.*` block contains all six filenames including the format-specific `referenceSourceOriginal` name
- `SessionScanner` accepts versions {2, 3, 4, 5}; v5 additionally validates that the files referenced in `files.captureOriginal` and `files.referenceSourceOriginal` exist on disk; v2/v3/v4 sessions without original files remain fully valid
- `SessionBackupExporter` is metadata-driven: reads the `files.*` block from each session's `metadata.json` to determine which files to export; handles v4 (4 files) and v5 (6 files) uniformly; variable-extension originals are handled automatically
- `EditSessionViewModel` reads `reference.sourceUri` first (v5), falls back to `reference.sourceDisplayName` (v2–v4)
- **Session Originals Privacy (2026-07-XX):** optional setting `strip_originals_metadata` (DataStore key, default `false`). Full specification: `SESSION_ORIGINALS_PRIVACY_V1.md`.
  - Privacy OFF (default): `capture-original.jpg` and `reference-source-original.*` are byte-for-byte copies; all EXIF/GPS/metadata intact; maximum restore fidelity
  - Privacy ON: session originals are metadata-stripped before writing to the session directory; MediaStore gallery photo is never modified; Compare (`capture.jpg` + `reference.jpg`) and `OriginalReferenceBadge` (`reference-original.jpg`) are unaffected
  - Capture path (Privacy ON): byte-level JPEG segment strip (APP1/XMP/IPTC removed, ICC kept); fallback to decode→orient→JPEG-95 re-encode for non-trivial EXIF orientation or malformed JPEG; GPS, EXIF DateTimeOriginal, Make/Model, MakerNotes removed; full resolution preserved
  - Reference source path (Privacy ON): format-specific decode→re-encode cycle — JPEG/HEIC/HEIF/WebP → JPEG 95; PNG → PNG (lossless); GIF/BMP → JPEG 95; AVIF API 31+ → JPEG 95, API 29–30 → `not_possible`; unknown MIME → `not_possible` (stored as-is, session still saved)
  - `metadata.json` `originals` block (only when Privacy ON): `privacyMode: true`, `capturePreservation`, `referenceSourcePreservation`, optional `referenceSourceStoredMimeType` (when output format differs from source)
  - `CameraViewModel` reads `stripOriginalsMetadata` from `SettingsRepository`, freezes the value at capture time (before IO), passes `stripMetadata` to `SessionStorage.saveSession()`
  - MIME inference fallback via `inferMimeTypeFromUri()` handles `file://` URIs where `ContentResolver.getType()` returns null (uses file extension)
- `metadata.json` schema is **v4** through 2026-06-21 (bumped from v3 in Block A, 2026-06-09): includes `capture.timestampMs` as the canonical capture timestamp inside the `capture` block; `session.createdAtMs` is preserved for backward compatibility and carries the same value
- `metadata.json` contains an `additional` block at session creation with fixed defaults: `isFavorite: false`, `visibility: "private"`, `source: "sameview"` (Block B, 2026-06-09); UI and update endpoint implemented 2026-06-20 via `SessionStorage.updateFavorite()` and `CameraViewModel.toggleFavorite()`
- `content` block is absent at session creation when no title is present (Block C, 2026-06-09); fixes §12.1 violation where `description: null` and `tags: []` were pre-populated; `updateTitle()` handles absent `content` block correctly via `optJSONObject("content") ?: JSONObject()`
- `reference.date` EXIF auto-population implemented (Block D, 2026-06-09): at session creation, `ReferenceImageMetadataReader` reads EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` and parses it to `"YYYY-MM-DD"`; plausibility filter rejects years < 1826 or > current year; non-lenient `Calendar` rejects invalid month/day values (e.g. month=99, Feb 31); when present, `reference.date`, `reference.dateSource = "exif"`, and `reference.userEdited = false` are written into the `reference` block; when absent or implausible, the three fields are omitted entirely; `ReferenceImageMetadata.exifDateTimeOriginal` is the carrier (trailing default `null`, no call-site changes required)
- `SessionStorage.updateReferenceDate()` implemented (Block E, 2026-06-09): storage-side write function for manual `reference.date` changes; signature `(sessionsRoot, sessionId, date: String?): Boolean`; `date != null` (valid) → writes `reference.date`, `reference.dateSource = "manual"`, `reference.userEdited = true`; `date == null` (remove) → removes `reference.date` and `reference.dateSource`, keeps `reference.userEdited = true`; invalid non-null date returns `false` without modifying anything; `isValidReferenceDate()` validates exact ISO 8601 precision levels ("YYYY", "YYYY-MM", "YYYY-MM-DD") with plausibility filter and non-lenient Calendar check; path traversal protection identical to `updateTitle()`; no UI, no scanner changes
- `SessionStorage.updateLocation()` implemented (Block F, 2026-06-09): storage-side write function for manual user location metadata; signature `(sessionsRoot, sessionId, displayName: String?, city: String?, country: String?): Boolean`; each string normalized via `trim().ifEmpty{null}`; when at least one field non-null → sets `location.displayName`/`city`/`country` (individually) and `location.userEdited = true`; when all fields null after normalization → removes entire `location` block; blank strings never stored; `captureLocation` and `referenceLocation` never modified; path traversal protection identical to `updateTitle()`; no format validation (plain text fields); no UI, no scanner changes
- `metadata.json` includes schema version, timestamp, file names, MediaStore URI, picker URI, optional title, optional GPS location fields (`captureLocation`, `referenceLocation`), and optional reference date fields (`reference.date`, `reference.dateSource`, `reference.userEdited`)
- Missing, corrupt, or incomplete session metadata is ignored during scanning
- Session writes are best-effort and do not invalidate the main MediaStore save; if `SessionStorage.saveSession` returns null after a successful MediaStore save, the user receives `capture_saved_compare_failed` instead of the generic `capture_saved`
- Session deletion only removes internal session folders
- Session operations accept only direct child session IDs; nested or traversal-like IDs are rejected with controlled failure
- User-authored text metadata (title, description, location fields) is sanitized on save via `MetadataTextSanitizer`: single-line fields (title, display name, city, country) do not persist pasted line breaks (replaced with space); description keeps line breaks; zero-width and Bidi override characters are removed; international characters, emojis, and normal punctuation are preserved; no length limits are introduced

### Shot Titles
- Optional session title stored in `metadata.json`
- Missing title field is valid
- Titles are trimmed; blank titles are stored as absent
- CompareScreen allows editing and removing a title
- CompareLibrary displays titles above timestamps when present
- Title-save failures were previously handled via a dedicated Snackbar (`compare_screen_title_save_failed`) in `CameraViewModel.updateSessionTitle()`; this path was removed as dead code (2026-07-09) — title editing now goes through the Edit Session flow (`SessionStorage.updateContent()`, `edit_session_save_failed`)

### Layout
- Fullscreen `Box` root
- Camera preview uses `fillMaxSize()`
- UI is layered above the preview and does not resize it
- Portrait controls are stacked above the bottom bar
- Landscape controls are aligned to the preview center, independent of the navigation bar
- Landscape bottom row is `Reference` / `Capture` / `Compare`
- Landscape opacity slider is centered above the button row
- Top-right History and Overflow actions stay visible in portrait and landscape
- Portrait uses the classic top-right horizontal History/Overflow layout
- Landscape uses adaptive side-rail History/Overflow placement based on navigation bar insets
- Landscape History/Overflow actions are vertically aligned and positioned in the upper side-rail area
- Landscape Overflow popup opens toward the free side area instead of overlapping the rail
- Overlay action menu stays visible and inside root bounds

---

## Compare Approach

The authoritative rendering architecture is `COMPARE_SESSION_RENDERING_V1.md`.

Session files per capture:

- `capture.jpg` — unmodified camera output
- `reference.jpg` — rendered deterministically via `ReferenceRenderer.render()` with frozen overlay geometry (overlayScale, overlayOffsetX, overlayOffsetY, referenceImageDisplayMode, viewport)
- `reference-original.jpg` — EXIF-oriented original reference, not used in normal compare rendering

`CompareScreen` renders only `capture.jpg` + `reference.jpg` — no geometry reconstruction at compare time.

The saved MediaStore capture is never composited with the overlay.

---

## Storage / Privacy / Release Hardening

- Manifest declares CAMERA, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION, ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION and INTERNET (see Permissions above)
- INTERNET is declared solely for the approved DeinWackelbild V1 network exception (per `CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTION.md`); the only network use is the explicit, user-initiated order flow
- No analytics, telemetry, tracking, or background/automatic upload is implemented; the only upload is the explicit, user-initiated DeinWackelbild transfer of two prepared, metadata-free images
- Android Photo Picker is used for reference image selection
- Captures are saved through MediaStore under `Pictures/SameView`
- Internal compare sessions are stored under `filesDir/sessions/`
- `backup_rules.xml` excludes `sessions/` from Auto Backup
- `data_extraction_rules.xml` excludes `sessions/` from cloud backup and device transfer
- `SessionDeleter` validates target paths against path traversal
- `SessionStorage.updateTitle` validates target paths against path traversal
- Invalid session IDs are rejected before IO/path traversal behavior and return controlled failure (`false`)
- Debug/session logs are guarded by `BuildConfig.DEBUG`
- R8 minify and resource shrinking are enabled for release
- Build and release artifacts are ignored by `.gitignore`

---

## Known Release-Relevant Residual Risks

No critical blockers are currently documented.

Accepted residual risks:
- Very large reference images can still increase memory pressure during session creation; failures are caught and the main MediaStore save remains the source of truth
- Overlay and library thumbnail image-load failures may produce limited visual feedback, but do not block navigation or core capture
- Delete failures are handled by rescanning state, but currently do not show a dedicated user-facing error
- DataStore read/write failures currently fall back to default settings behavior and do not show dedicated user-facing feedback

These are robustness/polish items, not known Closed Testing blockers.

### Session Metadata Editor

Full specification: `SESSION_METADATA_EDITOR_V1.md`
Implementation plan: `implementation_plans/historic/SESSION_METADATA_EDITOR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

Block A completed (2026-06-09):

- **Edit Session entry point** — `CompareScreen` overflow menu "Edit Title" + "Remove Title" items replaced with single "Edit Session" item; `onSaveTitle` parameter removed; `onEditSession: (() -> Unit)?` parameter added; title `AlertDialog` and all associated local state removed; `sessionTitle` prop is now read-only display (no local mutation)
- **`EditSessionScreen` navigation shell** — new fullscreen opaque composable in `com.isardomains.sameview.ui.compare`; `TopAppBar` with back icon, "Edit session" title, disabled Save button; scrollable empty body; no ViewModel, no state, no save logic
- **Navigation route** — `ROUTE_EDIT_SESSION_WITH_ARGS` added to `MainActivity`; `editSessionRoute()` helper function encodes `sessionId` via `Uri.encode()`; back navigation via `navController.popBackStack()`
- **Test suite updated** — 7 title-dialog tests removed; 5 tests renamed/updated; 1 new test `moreMenu_editSessionItem_invokesCallback` added; `setCompareContent()` helper updated to `onEditSession`

Latest verified test state (Session Metadata Editor Block A — Completed 2026-06-09):

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `CompareScreenTest` — 79/79 PASSED on SM-S911B (Android 16), BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2m 47s

No open Session Metadata Editor Block A tasks remain.

Block B completed (2026-06-09):

- **`EditSessionViewModel`** — new `@HiltViewModel` in `com.isardomains.sameview.ui.compare`; `sessionId` extracted from `SavedStateHandle["sessionId"]`; on `init`, reads `metadata.json` from `filesDir/sessions/<sessionId>/` on the IO dispatcher and populates five `StateFlow`s: `titleField`, `referenceDateField`, `locationDisplayNameField`, `locationCityField`, `locationCountryField`; `isLoading: StateFlow<Boolean>` starts `true`, guaranteed `false` in `finally` block; best-effort load — any exception leaves all fields at empty string without crashing
- **Injectable lambda** — `internal var metadataReader: (sessionsRoot: File, sessionId: String) -> InitialSessionFields` replaceable in tests; default reads and parses the actual file; `internal var ioDispatcher` replaceable for test dispatcher injection
- **`EditSessionScreen`** — `viewModel: EditSessionViewModel = hiltViewModel()` default parameter added; `MainActivity.kt` unchanged (no extra wiring needed; identical pattern to `CreateVideoScreen`)
- **`EditSessionViewModelTest`** — 6 unit tests using `StandardTestDispatcher` so the `init` coroutine is queued but not started during construction; `ioDispatcher` and `metadataReader` overridden after construction before `advanceUntilIdle()`; tests cover: title load, referenceDate load, all three location fields load, all-fields-empty on IOException, all-fields-empty when blocks absent, `isLoading` true→false transition

Latest verified test state (Session Metadata Editor Block B — Completed 2026-06-09):

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 394/394 unit tests passed, 0 failures
- `EditSessionViewModelTest` — 6/6 PASSED

No open Session Metadata Editor Block B tasks remain.

Block C completed (2026-06-09):

- **Title field** — `OutlinedTextField` added to `EditSessionScreen`; `titleField` collected via `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`; `onValueChange` wired to new `onTitleChanged(value: String)` function in `EditSessionViewModel`; `singleLine = true`, `ImeAction.Done` + `clearFocus()`; pre-populated from Block B initial load; Save button remains disabled; string resource `edit_session_field_title` added
- **`EditSessionViewModelTest`** — `onTitleChanged_updatesState` added; 7/7 tests pass

Latest verified test state (Session Metadata Editor Block C — Completed 2026-06-09):

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 395/395 unit tests passed, 0 failures
- `EditSessionViewModelTest` — 7/7 PASSED
- `assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL

No open Session Metadata Editor Block C tasks remain.

Block D completed (2026-06-09):

- **Shared validation** — `SessionStorage.isValidReferenceDate()` changed from `private` to `internal` (1-word change); single source of truth for date format validation; no duplication
- **Reference date field** — `OutlinedTextField` added to `EditSessionScreen`; `referenceDate` and `referenceError` collected via `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`; placeholder hint, `isError`, conditional `supportingText` for error display; `ImeAction.Done` + `clearFocus()`
- **Title field IME** — changed from `ImeAction.Done` to `ImeAction.Next` with `moveFocus(FocusDirection.Down)` to chain keyboard navigation to Reference Date
- **`EditSessionViewModel`** — `internal val _referenceDateError: MutableStateFlow<String?>` (null initially; accessible in tests); `referenceDateError: StateFlow<String?>`; `onReferenceDateChanged()` (updates field, clears error); `internal fun isValidReferenceDateInput()` (empty/blank → true; non-empty → delegates to `SessionStorage.isValidReferenceDate(trimmed)`); error state is present but stays null in Block D (no save trigger yet)
- **`EditSessionViewModelTest`** — 12 new tests: `onReferenceDateChanged_clearsPreviousError` + 11 validation cases; 19/19 pass

Latest verified test state (Session Metadata Editor Block D — Completed 2026-06-09):

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 407/407 unit tests passed, 0 failures
- `EditSessionViewModelTest` — 19/19 PASSED
- `assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL

No open Session Metadata Editor Block D tasks remain.

Block E completed (2026-06-09):

- **Location fields** — three `OutlinedTextField`s added to `EditSessionScreen`: Location (display name), City, Country; each wired to its own `StateFlow` via `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` and to `onLocationDisplayNameChanged()`, `onLocationCityChanged()`, `onLocationCountryChanged()` in `EditSessionViewModel`; all three handler functions set their respective `MutableStateFlow` directly without normalization or coroutine
- **Reference Date IME** — `ImeAction` changed from `Done` to `Next` + `moveFocus(FocusDirection.Down)` to chain keyboard focus into the location fields
- **IME chain** — Title → Reference Date → Location → City → Country (Done + clearFocus); Country is the final field and clears focus on Done
- **No GPS coupling** — location fields are architecturally isolated; `captureLocation`/`referenceLocation` are not touched; no reverse geocoding
- **Save remains disabled** — `TextButton(enabled = false)` unchanged; no `onSave` logic in Block E
- **`EditSessionViewModelTest`** — three new tests added: `onLocationDisplayNameChanged_updatesState`, `onLocationCityChanged_updatesState`, `onLocationCountryChanged_updatesState`

Latest verified test state (Session Metadata Editor Block E — Completed 2026-06-09):

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 22/22 `EditSessionViewModelTest` PASSED, 0 failures
- `assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL

No open Session Metadata Editor Block E tasks remain.

Block F completed (2026-06-09):

- **`EditSessionEvent`** — `sealed interface EditSessionEvent` with `data object SaveComplete` and `data object SaveFailed`; declared at package level in `EditSessionViewModel.kt`; exposed as `SharedFlow<EditSessionEvent>` from `events` property
- **`isDirty` and `isSaving`** — both `StateFlow<Boolean>` added to `EditSessionViewModel`; `isDirty` computed via `updateIsDirty()` called from every `onXxxChanged()` handler; `isSaving` set true at start of `onSave()` coroutine, guaranteed false in `finally`; Save button `enabled = isDirty && !isSaving`
- **`normalizeField()`** — `private fun normalizeField(s: String): String? = s.trim().ifEmpty { null }`; blank input always becomes null at save time; display values are never modified
- **`onSave()`** — validates reference date first (sets `referenceDateError`, returns without writing on failure); then `_isSaving.value = true`; writes changed field groups in order: title → referenceDate → location (all-or-nothing per group, not per field); on any storage write returning `false`, emits `SaveFailed` and returns; on all writes succeeding (or no writes needed), updates `initial*` vars, calls `updateIsDirty()` (resets `isDirty` to false), emits `SaveComplete`
- **Injectable storage lambdas** — `internal var sessionTitleUpdater`, `sessionReferenceDateUpdater`, `sessionLocationUpdater` (all replaceable in tests); defaults delegate to `SessionStorage.updateTitle/updateReferenceDate/updateLocation` respectively
- **`EditSessionScreen`** — `viewModel: EditSessionViewModel` is now a **required parameter** (no `= hiltViewModel()` default); `isDirty` and `isSaving` collected via `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`; Save button wired to `viewModel::onSave` and `enabled = isDirty && !isSaving`
- **`MainActivity`** — `ROUTE_EDIT_SESSION_WITH_ARGS` composable fully wired: creates `editSessionViewModel = hiltViewModel()` and `cameraViewModel = hiltViewModel(cameraEntry)`; `LaunchedEffect` collects `editSessionViewModel.events`; `SaveComplete` → `cameraViewModel.refreshSavedSessions()` + `navController.popBackStack()`; `SaveFailed` → `snackbarHostState.showSnackbar(saveFailedMessage)`; `SnackbarHost` rendered at bottom of screen
- **`strings.xml`** — `edit_session_save_failed` → `"Couldn't save changes"` added
- **`EditSessionViewModelTest`** — 24 new tests added (isDirty tracking, onSave paths, event emission, storage call order, isSaving state); `createViewModel` helper updated with `titleUpdater`, `referenceDateUpdater`, `locationUpdater` parameters (all with defaults); `reader` moved to last position so existing trailing-lambda calls continue to work

Latest verified test state (Session Metadata Editor Block F — Completed 2026-06-09):

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 46/46 `EditSessionViewModelTest` PASSED (22 existing + 24 new)
- `assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL

No open Session Metadata Editor Block F tasks remain.

Block G completed (2026-06-09):

- **Back handling** — `EditSessionScreen` now intercepts both system back and the TopAppBar back icon. `BackHandler(enabled = isSaving || isDirty)` is active whenever either state is true.
- **Dirty back → Discard dialog** — when `isSaving == false && isDirty == true`, pressing back shows a Material 3 `AlertDialog`: title "Discard changes?", body "Your changes have not been saved.", confirm "Discard" (navigates back via `onBack()`), dismiss "Keep editing" (closes dialog).
- **Saving back → Saving-in-progress dialog** — when `isSaving == true`, pressing back shows an information dialog: title "Saving changes", body "Please wait until saving is finished.", confirm "OK" (closes dialog). Navigation is blocked; the save continues running.
- **Clean back** — when both `isDirty == false` and `isSaving == false`, back navigates immediately via `onBack()` with no dialog.
- **SaveComplete path unchanged** — `isDirty == false` is guaranteed before `SaveComplete` is emitted, so the `BackHandler` is disabled at navigation time; no dialog risk.
- **No ViewModel changes** — `isDirty` and `isSaving` were already implemented in Block F. Block G is purely a screen-level change.
- **7 new string resources** — 4 discard dialog strings + 3 saving dialog strings added to `strings.xml`.

Latest verified test state (Session Metadata Editor Block G — Completed 2026-06-09):

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, all 46 `EditSessionViewModelTest` PASSED
- `assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL

No open Session Metadata Editor Block G tasks remain.

Block UX completed (2026-06-09) — Session Metadata Editor UX Correction (Pre-Block-H):

- **`SessionStorage.updateContent()`** — new atomic write function `(sessionsRoot, sessionId, title: String?, description: String?): Boolean`; trims both fields, blank → null; reads or creates `content` JSONObject; sets/removes title and description individually; **always writes back** `json.put("content", content)` — never removes the block even when both fields are null; path traversal protection identical to `updateTitle()`; returns false on missing metadata.json, invalid sessionId, IO or security errors; `updateTitle()` is preserved and unchanged
- **`InitialSessionFields`** extended — `description: String = ""`, `captureTimestampMs: Long = 0L`, `referenceSourceDisplayName: String = ""` added with **default values** so all existing positional test call sites compile without changes
- **`EditSessionViewModel`** extended — `descriptionField: StateFlow<String>` + `onDescriptionChanged()`; `captureTimestampMs: StateFlow<Long>` (read-only, from `capture.timestampMs`); `referenceSourceDisplayName: StateFlow<String>` (read-only, from `reference.sourceDisplayName`); `sessionTitleUpdater` lambda **replaced** by `sessionContentUpdater: (File, String, String?, String?) -> Boolean` (defaults to `SessionStorage.updateContent`); `updateIsDirty()` extended to include description; `onSave()` uses `sessionContentUpdater` atomically for title + description; `initialDescription` reset after successful save; `metadataReader` reads all new fields
- **`EditSessionScreen`** — fully rebuilt: `TopAppBar` subtitle column ("Update information about this comparison") in `SameViewSettingsSecondaryText`; Save button moved to `Scaffold.bottomBar` as `Button` with `imePadding()` + `navigationBarsPadding()`, `enabled = isDirty && !isSaving`; 3 `SettingsCard` groups: **Session** (title + description minLines=3), **Reference Photo** (thumbnail 64dp + filename/session date labels + reference date field with DatePicker), **Location** (place name + city + country); `Column(Arrangement.spacedBy(14.dp))` layout; `referenceImageUri` via `remember(viewModel.sessionId)`, `referenceFilename` via `remember(referenceSourceDisplayName)`, `captureDate` via `remember(captureTimestampMs, locale)` using `DateFormat.MEDIUM`; `DatePickerDialog` triggered by calendar `IconButton` trailing on reference date field; all Block G dialogs (discard, saving-in-progress) preserved; location display-name field now uses `edit_session_field_place_name` label
- **`strings.xml`** — `edit_session_screen_title` value updated to "Edit Session" (capital S); 17 new strings added: `edit_session_subtitle`, `edit_session_save_changes`, `edit_session_card_session`, `edit_session_card_reference_photo`, `edit_session_card_location`, `edit_session_field_description`, `edit_session_placeholder_title`, `edit_session_placeholder_description`, `edit_session_placeholder_reference_date`, `edit_session_reference_date_help`, `edit_session_label_filename`, `edit_session_label_session_date`, `edit_session_pick_date_content_description`, `edit_session_field_place_name`, `edit_session_placeholder_place_name`, `edit_session_placeholder_city`, `edit_session_placeholder_country`
- **`EditSessionViewModelTest`** — `createViewModel()` helper: `titleUpdater` param replaced by `contentUpdater: (File, String, String?, String?) -> Boolean`; 7 tests migrated (`onSave_withValidTitle_callsTitleUpdater` → `onSave_withChangedTitle_callsContentUpdater`, etc.); 4 new description tests added; 50/50 pass
- **`SessionStorageMetadataTest`** — `createSessionWithContentFields()` helper added; 6 new `updateContent_*` tests added (require instrumented device run)
- **Stable contracts unchanged** — `updateTitle()`, `updateReferenceDate()`, `updateLocation()` in `SessionStorage`; `EditSessionEvent` sealed interface; `ROUTE_EDIT_SESSION_WITH_ARGS` in `MainActivity`; `BackHandler` / discard / saving-in-progress dialog logic in `EditSessionScreen`

Block UX6 completed (2026-06-09) — Session Metadata Editor Final UX Cleanup Before Block H:

- **Session Card auf einzeilige Metadaten-Darstellung reduziert** — zwei-zeilige Darstellung (Label "Session date" + Wert) ersetzt durch einzelne Textzeile `"Captured on Jun 9, 2026 19:22"` mit formatierbarem String `edit_session_captured_on` = `"Captured on %s"`; ein `Text`-Composable statt zwei; `SameViewSettingsSecondaryText`/`bodySmall` Stil.
- **Reference-Date-Hilfetext aus TextField ausgelagert** — `supportingText`-Parameter aus `OutlinedTextField` entfernt; Help-Text und Error-Text werden jetzt als freie `Text`-Composables unterhalb der Thumbnail/Field-Row gerendert, über volle Card-Breite; `isError` verbleibt am TextField (rote Outline bleibt aktiv); Error-Text in `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.error`; 4dp-Spacer zwischen Row und Hilfetext.
- **Current Photo Card visuell an Reference Photo Card angeglichen** — plain `Column` ersetzt durch `Box` mit `Modifier.border(1.dp, outline, extraSmall)`, `heightIn(min = 56.dp)`, `padding(16/8dp)` und `Modifier.weight(1f)`; Label + Wert im Box-Inneren; keine Fokus-, Cursor- oder Klick-Affordance.

Block UX7 completed (2026-06-10) — Session Metadata Editor Final Visual Alignment Fix:

- **Session Card Header vereinfacht** — Card-Titel "Session" entfernt; `captureDateWithTime` wird jetzt direkt als Card-Header übergeben (`SettingsCard(title = ...)`), formatiert als `"Created %s"` / `"Erstellt am %s"` mit neuem formatierbarem String `edit_session_created`; wenn kein Timestamp vorhanden, `title = null` (Card ohne Titel). Bisheriges Body-`Text`-Composable mit `edit_session_captured_on` und `Spacer(8.dp)` entfernt. Typografie, Farbe und Abstände identisch mit altem "Session"-Header (SettingsCard-interne Darstellung unverändert).
- **Current Photo Card Display-Box vertikal zentriert** — `Row(verticalAlignment = Alignment.Top)` → `Row(verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically)`; die Display-Box und das Thumbnail werden jetzt auf der gemeinsamen Mittelachse ausgerichtet. Größe, Breite und Inhalt der Box unverändert.

Block H completed (2026-06-10) — Session Metadata Editor Instrumentation/UI Tests:

- **`EditSessionScreenTest`** — new instrumentation test class in `com.isardomains.sameview.ui.compare`; 22 tests across five groups: screen structure (8 tests: root present, back/save buttons present, all six field test tags present, created header when timestamp available, absence of standalone "Session" card title, reference/current/location cards present, captured-on label present), field pre-population (3 tests: title, reference date, and location fields), Save button state (4 tests: disabled initially; enabled after title, description, reference date, or location change), back/discard dialog navigation (4 tests: immediate back with no changes invokes callback, back with changes shows discard dialog, confirm navigates back, cancel keeps editor open), reference date validation UI (2 tests: invalid date shows error text, valid date shows no error text)
- **Test infrastructure** — `setEditSessionContent()` launches `ComponentActivity` via `ActivityScenario`, wires `EditSessionViewModel` with a real `SavedStateHandle`, and awaits `isLoading == false` before proceeding; `createSession()` writes a v4-compatible `metadata.json` plus reference and capture JPEG stubs into `filesDir/sessions/<sessionId>/`; `wakeTestDevice()` fires `KEYCODE_WAKEUP` to prevent display-off timing failures; `@After tearDown()` closes the scenario and deletes temp session directories

Latest verified test state (Session Metadata Editor Block H — Completed 2026-06-10):

- `connectedDebugAndroidTest` full suite (482 tests) — 481/482 across two consecutive runs; one consistent failure in `MediaStoreWriterGpsTest.save_noGps_whenGpsSnapshotNull`; root cause: known Samsung IS_PENDING/media-scanner timing race (see Video Export Block 7 full-suite note for prior manifestation as `save_hasGpsTags_whenGpsSnapshotPresent`); both affected methods pass 3/3 in isolation; no functional coupling between Block H and `MediaStoreWriter` or `GpsExifWriter`; pre-existing device-state flake, full suite not claimed as fully green

**Favourite Star in EditSessionScreen (Block F.3 + bugfix — 2026-06-20):**

- `EditSessionScreen` TopAppBar receives a Favourite star action (first action; consistent with CompareScreen)
- `EditSessionViewModel` exposes `isFavorite: StateFlow<Boolean>` loaded from `metadata.json`; `toggleFavorite()` performs an optimistic flip followed by `SessionStorage.updateFavorite()` on IO dispatcher
- Toggle does NOT affect `isDirty`; Save button and Discard dialog are unaffected
- `EditSessionEvent.FavoriteToggleComplete` emitted on success; `MainActivity` handles it by calling `cameraViewModel.refreshSavedSessions()` (no navigation) — this fixes the bug where `CompareScreen` showed a stale star after Favourite-only Back from EditSession
- `EditSessionViewModelTest` extended with `favoriteUpdater` injectable lambda and 2 new tests
- `EditSessionScreenTest` extended with 6 new `favoriteButton_*` tests; 28/28 PASSED

---

Block UX5 completed (2026-06-09) — Session Metadata Editor Pre-Block-H UX Fix:

- **Session date priorisiert** — in der Session Card steht "Session date" jetzt als erstes Element, vor Title und Description; die Hauptinformation der Session ist damit sofort sichtbar.
- **Session date Zeitgenauigkeit unified** — Session Card verwendet nun `captureDateWithTime` (Datum + Uhrzeit, z. B. "Jun 9, 2026 19:22") statt `captureDate` (nur Datum); konsistent mit CompareScreen und Current photo Card. `captureDate`-Derivation und unbenutzter `locale`-Import entfernt.
- **Reference-Date-Hilfetext korrigiert** — `edit_session_reference_date_help` zeigt jetzt die tatsächlich akzeptierten ISO-8601-Eingabeformate (`2008`, `2008-06`, `2008-06-15`); vorheriger Text zeigte "June 2008" / "June 15, 2008", was die Validierung ablehnt.

- **Thumbnails enlarged** — both the Reference photo and Current photo thumbnails increased from 64 dp to 80 dp; shape, crop logic, and layout unchanged.
- **Reference date help text improved** — `edit_session_reference_date_help` rewritten from technical ISO format examples to user-friendly natural-language examples ("Reference photo date. Examples: 2008, June 2008, or June 15, 2008."); German translation updated accordingly; storage formats and validation unchanged.

- **Placeholders corrected** — all generic placeholder text replaced with concrete examples: Title → "e.g. Summer vacation in Italy", Description → "Add notes about this moment", Place name → "e.g. Marienplatz", City → "e.g. Munich", Country → "e.g. Germany".
- **Session date moved** — "Session date" display (read-only, from `captureTimestampMs`) moved from the Reference photo card into the Session card; shown below the Description field when a capture timestamp is available.
- **Filename removed** — filename label and value removed from the Reference photo card; `edit_session_label_filename` string resource removed; `referenceFilename` derivation and `referenceSourceDisplayName` collection removed from `EditSessionScreen`.
- **Current photo card added** — new fourth card between "Reference photo" and "Location"; shows only the capture thumbnail (`capture.jpg`); no labels, no metadata, no actions.
- **Reference photo card reduced** — now contains only: reference thumbnail, reference date field, DatePicker icon, and help text. Filename and session date are gone.
- **Card order** — Session → Reference photo → Current photo → Location.

### Compare Slider Date Labels and Handle Refresh

**Status:** Completed  
**Specification:** `COMPARE_FLOW_V1.md §41`  
**Implementation date:** 2026-06-10

This block implements the handle redesign and temporal date labels specified in `COMPARE_FLOW_V1.md §41`. It was enabled by the Session Metadata v4 work (Blocks A–F), which established reliable availability of `reference.date` and `capture.timestampMs` in `metadata.json`.

**Step 1 — Data-layer prerequisites (commit e15bdb3):**

- `SavedSessionRef` — `referenceDate: String?` added; `saveSession()` derives it from `reference.date`
- `ScannedSession` — `referenceDate: String?` added; `validateUnsafe()` reads `json.optJSONObject("reference")?.optString("date")`
- `CompareInput` — `referenceDate: String?` added; populated from `SavedSessionRef` in `onCaptureSaved()`
- `MainActivity` — route, both `compareRoute()` overloads, and the `CompareScreen` call extended with `referenceDate`
- `CompareScreen` — new `referenceDate: String?` parameter, threaded to `CompareSliderViewport`
- `SessionScannerTest` — coverage for `referenceDate` propagation added

**Step 2 — UI/UX layer (commit 3fb489d):**

- `CompareLabelLogic.kt` (new) — pure function `computeCompareLabels` with 5-level priority chain; locale-aware `SimpleDateFormat`; no Compose/Android Context dependency; `CompareLabelPair` data class
- `CompareDivider` handle redesigned — 40dp (was 32dp) filled circle in `SameViewAccent` blue with white `KeyboardArrowLeft`/`KeyboardArrowRight` icons
- Moving text labels left/right of handle; per-label edge-hiding via `rememberTextMeasurer()`; text shadow for contrast
- Accessibility: `compare_slider_labels_content_description` format string always includes both label values, even when edge-hidden
- Reference and Current image-overlay badges removed from `CompareSliderViewport`; `OriginalReferenceBadge` retained unchanged
- `CompareLabelLogicTest.kt` (new) — 16 unit tests covering all 5 levels, precision boundaries, and German locale
- `CompareScreenTest.kt` — 8 affected tests updated; 7 new UI tests added (86 total)
- `strings.xml` (EN + DE) — `compare_label_past`, `compare_label_present`, `compare_label_current`, `compare_slider_labels_content_description` added

Full UX spec, five-level label logic, edge behavior, fullscreen behavior, accessibility, and i18n: `COMPARE_FLOW_V1.md §41`.

Latest verified test state (Compare Slider Date Labels and Handle Refresh — Completed 2026-06-10):

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `CompareLabelLogicTest` — 16/16 PASSED (JVM unit tests)
- `CompareScreenTest` — 86/86 PASSED on SM-S911B (Android 16)
- `MediaStoreWriterGpsTest` (isolated) — 3/3 PASSED on SM-S911B (Android 16)
- Manual smoke test — completed successfully
- `connectedDebugAndroidTest` full suite — 1 consistent failure in `MediaStoreWriterGpsTest.save_hasGpsTags_whenGpsSnapshotPresent`; pre-existing Samsung IS_PENDING/media-scanner timing race; passes 3/3 in isolation; not caused by this block; same category as Block H flakiness; full suite not claimed as fully green

Spec correction (2026-06-10): Level 3 condition relaxed — day precision now always produces `d MMM` labels when year and month match, including same-day (`10 Jun ↔ 10 Jun`). Level 4 no longer covers the day-precision same-date case. `CompareLabelLogicTest.level3_sameYear_sameMonth_sameDays_dayPrecision` updated accordingly; full unit test suite green.

No open Compare Slider Date Labels and Handle Refresh tasks remain.

## Open Future UX Investigations

This section tracks UX questions that are deliberately left open — not committed features, but unresolved questions that must be investigated before they can become product decisions.

### Reference Date Override Transparency

**Question:** Should users be able to see whether a session's reference date was automatically detected from EXIF metadata or manually entered?

**Context:** `reference.dateSource` (`"exif"` or `"manual"`) and `reference.userEdited` are persisted in `metadata.json` at creation and update time. The Session Metadata Editor V1 does not expose this distinction in the UI — all reference dates appear identically regardless of origin. A user who corrects an EXIF-derived date has no confirmation that their edit superseded the automatic value.

**Not a V1 requirement. No implementation. No `reference.originalDate` field.** No UI change until this investigation produces a product decision.

**Cross-reference:** `SESSION_METADATA_EDITOR_V1.md §19` already lists "Visual indicator showing whether the current date was set from EXIF or manually" and "Read-only original EXIF date hint with Reset action" as explicitly deferred future extensions. The investigation point here is whether either of these additions would meaningfully help users, or whether the `dateSource`/`userEdited` distinction is too technical to warrant surface-level exposure in V1 UX.

---

## Localization

### English Sentence Case Rule

User-facing English strings (labels, screen titles, buttons, section headings) use **Sentence case**: first word capitalised, all others lowercase unless they are proper nouns or product names.

Exceptions: **SameView**, **Compare Slider**, **Before & After**, **#MadeWithSameView**.

This rule applies to all new strings added to `values/strings.xml`. It does not affect non-visible strings (content descriptions, format strings, test tags, error keys).

### German Tone Rule

German localization uses informal user address consistently.

- Use: `du`, `dir`, `dich`, `dein`, `deine`, `deiner`, `deinem`
- Do not use: `Sie`, `Ihnen`, `Ihr`, `Ihre`, `Ihren`, `Ihrem`
- Imperative forms must be informal: `Öffne`, `Wähle`, `Tippe`, `Aktiviere`
- Never use formal imperative: `Öffnen Sie`, `Wählen Sie`, `Tippen Sie`

This rule applies to all user-facing German strings in `values-de/strings.xml`.
Non-user-facing strings (content descriptions, test tags) are not affected.

---

## Practical Working Rules

### Scope discipline
- Only implement the requested feature
- No speculative future features

### Change discipline
- Keep changes minimal
- No refactoring outside scope

### UI discipline
- No layout that resizes preview
- Use central color definitions
- Keep camera controls practical and uncluttered

### State
- ViewModel is source of truth for active camera-session state
- No persistence of active overlay/camera state across full app restarts

### Testability
- Keep logic testable
- Do not introduce complex UI logic in Composables

---

## Current Verification Notes

Existing tests cover the critical release paths around:
- ViewModel overlay/reference state
- capture lock and capture error handling
- snackbar replay protection
- session scanner/storage/deleter behavior
- title metadata read/write behavior
- title-update exception boundary (ViewModel-level `catch(Exception)`, failure Snackbar path verified via `updateSessionTitle_updaterThrows_emitsSnackbarFailure`)
- session-save failure feedback path: `capture_saved_compare_failed` Snackbar surfaced when MediaStore save succeeds but `SessionStorage.saveSession` returns null (`onCaptureSaved_withSnapshotButNoSessionRef_emitsCaptureCompareFailedSnackbar`, `onCaptureSaved_withSnapshotButNoSessionRef_setsCaptureSuccessHadReferenceTrue`)
- compare navigation
- compare slider and fullscreen behavior
- compare library grid, navigation, selection, delete, and title display
- Camera top-right History/Overflow navigation
- stable Compare button semantics and disabled Compare hints
- Camera controls, landscape alignment, grid, and capture feedback
- Overlay coverage computation and live visibility warning state
- Settings persistence and settings-driven workflow behavior
- GPS activation lifecycle (all four conditions, start/stop, duplicate-start prevention)
- GPS guidance state computation (proximity colors, hysteresis, bearing suppression, distance thresholds)
- GPS snapshot freeze at capture time (null when guidance OFF, null when no fix, correct values when fix present, immutability after later location updates)
- GPS EXIF writing (DMS rational format, altitude, GPSDateStamp, GPSTimeStamp, GPSProcessingMethod, orientation invariant)
- GPS EXIF in MediaStore image and capture.jpg (instrumentation: MediaStoreWriterGpsTest, SessionStorageGpsTest)
- GPS metadata in metadata.json (captureLocation, referenceLocation presence/absence)
- reference.jpg never receives GPS; reference-original.jpg preserves GPS when present
- session backup export: ZIP structure, byte integrity, operation locks, SAF null-URI no-op handling
- CompareScreen overflow: Backup Session visibility (sessionId != null), disabled state during backup
- CompareLibrary backup: icon presence, disabled states (empty selection, isBackupInProgress, isDeletionInProgress)
- Select All sets selectedSessionIds to the **current filtered view** (not all sessions unconditionally); this supersedes the prior "complete scanned session list" behavior — see `FAVORITES_AND_LIBRARY_FILTERS_V1.md PD-08`

### Animated Mode Preview (2026-06-12)

Post-Block-7 addition. Implements the animated mode preview inside the Configuring state of `CreateVideoScreen`.

**Neue Datei:** `VideoModePreview.kt` in `com.isardomains.sameview.ui.video`

- Composable `VideoModePreview(mode, sessionDir)` — 16:9 Frame, max 200 dp Höhe, horizontal zentriert via `BoxWithConstraints`
- Lädt `reference.jpg` / `capture.jpg` aus `sessionDir` via Coil `AsyncImage`
- **Compare Slider:** Hold-Reference → Sweep links→rechts (Cubic Smoothstep) → Hold-Capture → Pause → Restart; 4 s Loop via `InfiniteTransition`
- **Before & After:** Hold-Reference → Crossfade 500 ms → Hold-Capture → Pause → Restart; 4 s Loop via `InfiniteTransition`
- Moduswechsel: 175 ms `Crossfade`; neue Animation startet sofort
- Reduce Motion (`ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE == 0`): keine `InfiniteTransition`; Slider-Modus statisch mit 50 %-Split + Divider-Linie; B&A-Modus statisch beide Bilder bei 0.5 Alpha überlagert
- Accessibility: `Modifier.clearAndSetSemantics {}` — nur Preview-Frame ausgeblendet, nicht Card oder Segment-Control

**Geändert:** `CreateVideoScreen.kt`

- `sessionDir` lokal berechnet: `File(context.filesDir, "sessions/${viewModel.sessionId}")`; kein neues ViewModel-Feld
- `HorizontalDivider` + `VideoModePreview` in Video-Type-`SettingsCard` nach Segment-Control eingefügt
- Neuer Parameter `sessionDir: File` in `ConfiguringContent`
- Neuer Import: `HorizontalDivider`, `java.io.File`

**Nicht geändert:** `CreateVideoViewModel`, Export-Pipeline, `CompareScreen`, `MainActivity`, `SettingsRepository`, `strings.xml`, Gradle, Manifest, Navigation, Tests

**Test-Status:** `testDebugUnitTest` + `assembleDebug` + `assembleRelease` — siehe aktuellen Build-Status

**Manuelle Verifikation offen:** CreateVideoScreen Portrait, CreateVideoScreen Landscape, Compare Slider Preview, Before & After Preview, Reduce Motion ON, Tablet/großes Layout (falls nicht verfügbar)

T-I-04 (`t_i_04_deleteVideo_removesEntryFromMediaStore`) added to `VideoExportPipelineTest.kt` in Block 7. No production code changes.

Test infrastructure fix (Block 7): `PhotoPickerMimicContentProvider` and `SafMimicContentProvider` moved from `app/src/androidTest/` to `app/src/debug/` so their classes live in the app APK's classloader. Root cause: the classes landed in DEX shard 11 of the test APK; `Application.getClassLoader()` in the app process cannot reach secondary DEX shards at ContentProvider instantiation time. Moving to `src/debug/` places them in the app APK's own primary DEX. Additionally, `require_original=1` is now pre-embedded in `PhotoPickerMimicContentProvider.uriFor()` because `MediaStore.setRequireOriginal()` on Android 16 rejects non-MediaStore authorities (throws `IllegalArgumentException`), which was silently caught by `resolveSourceUri()` and prevented the original file from being served. No changes to production code or test logic.

Full suite status: the full `connectedDebugAndroidTest` (407 tests) ran twice on SM-S911B (Android 16). Each run produced one different flaky failure:

- Run 1: `AboutScreenTest.aboutContent_showsCoreV2Information` — Compose Activity timing race ("No compose hierarchies found")
- Run 2: `MediaStoreWriterGpsTest.save_hasGpsTags_whenGpsSnapshotPresent` — transient MediaStore `.pending` ENOENT

Both tests pass cleanly in isolation (3/3 each). These are pre-existing device-state flaky failures unrelated to Video Export. The full suite is **not claimed as fully green**. This flakiness is tracked outside Video Export scope.

For the next Closed Testing upload, re-run the following verifications after any code change:

- unit tests
- connected instrumentation tests
- release build/sign/install smoke test on a real device

### Block 9 — Flash Video Mode + Branding Timing Model (2026-06-17)

**Neue Dateien:**

| Datei | Inhalt |
|---|---|
| `video/FlashRenderEngine.kt` | `FlashRenderEngine : VideoFrameRenderer`; Phase 1 (45 Frames Hold, Reference+Overlay), Phase 2 (Hard-Cut-Wechsel Reference/Capture); Fill-Semantik; companion object mit `FLASH_HOLD_FRAMES=45`, `cycleCount()`, `showCaptureAt()` |
| `video/FlashRenderEngineTest.kt` | T-F-U-01–T-F-U-09; 21 Unit-Tests für Frame-Count, Phase-Grenzen, Zyklus-Logik, Endframe=Capture |
| `androidTest/video/VideoExportPipelineFlashTest.kt` | T-F-I-01, T-F-I-02; End-to-End-Tests (Flash MP4 gültig; Dateiname endet auf `_flash.mp4`; Duration-Check mit neuem Branding-Modell) |

**Geänderte Produktionsdateien:**

| Datei | Änderung |
|---|---|
| `video/VideoRenderConfig.kt` | `VideoMode.FLASH` ergänzt; `animationFrameCount` gibt jetzt immer `durationMs × 30 / 1000` zurück (Branding-Timing-Modell-Änderung) |
| `video/VideoExportPipeline.kt` | `createRenderer()` + `buildDisplayName()` + `computeHoldFrameCount()` um `FLASH`-Zweig erweitert; Flash-HoldFrameCount = `FlashRenderEngine.FLASH_HOLD_FRAMES` (45, fest) |
| `ui/video/CreateVideoScreen.kt` | 3. Modus (`VideoMode.FLASH`) im Segment-Control; `create_video_branding_hint`-Text unter Branding-Toggle (dauerhaft sichtbar, `bodySmall`, `SameViewSettingsSecondaryText`) |
| `ui/video/VideoModePreview.kt` | `FLASH`-Zweig mit `FlashStatic` (beide Bilder 0.5 Alpha) und `FlashAnimated` (Hard-Cut via `flashShowCaptureFromProgress`) |
| `ui/video/VideoLoadingPreview.kt` | `FLASH`-Zweig mit `FlashLoadingStatic` und `FlashLoadingAnimated` + `FlashLoadingFrame` (ContentScale.Crop) |
| `values/strings.xml` | `create_video_mode_compare_slider` → "Compare"; neu: `create_video_mode_flash` = "Flash"; `create_video_branding_hint` = "Adds 1.5 seconds to your video" |
| `values-de/strings.xml` | `create_video_mode_compare_slider` → "Compare"; neu: `create_video_mode_flash` = "Flash"; `create_video_branding_hint` = "Fügt deinem Video 1,5 Sekunden hinzu" |

**Geänderte Testdateien (Wertanpassungen durch Branding-Timing-Modell):**

| Datei | Änderung |
|---|---|
| `VideoRenderConfigTest.kt` | T-U-09: Assertions 75+45=120, 135+45=180, 195+45=240 → 120+45=165, 180+45=225, 240+45=285 |
| `CompareSliderRenderEngineTest.kt` | T-U-01 branding ON: `is75`, `is135`, `is195` → `is120`, `is180`, `is240` |
| `BeforeAfterRenderEngineTest.kt` | T-U-05 branding ON: identische Änderungen |
| `VideoExportPipelineStandardTest.kt` | T-I-02: Duration-Assertion `≈durationMs` → `≈durationMs + BRANDING_DURATION_MS` (3500 ms) |

**Branding-Timing-Modell — Zusammenfassung der Änderung:**

Vorher: `animationFrameCount = (selectedDuration − brandingDuration) wenn branding ON`. Gesamt-Video = immer = selectedDuration.

Neu: `animationFrameCount = selectedDuration` (immer). Endcard wird additiv angehängt. Gesamt-Video = selectedDuration + 1.5 s (wenn branding ON). Die gewählte Dauer beschreibt immer die eigentliche Animationsdauer — unabhängig vom Branding-Toggle. Gilt für alle drei Modi gleichmäßig.

**Teststatus (2026-06-17):**

| Test | Status |
|---|---|
| `testDebugUnitTest` (gesamt) | PASSED |
| `FlashRenderEngineTest` (21 Tests) | PASSED |
| `CompareSliderRenderEngineTest` | PASSED |
| `BeforeAfterRenderEngineTest` | PASSED |
| `VideoRenderConfigTest` | PASSED |
| `assembleDebug` | BUILD SUCCESSFUL |
| `assembleRelease` | BUILD SUCCESSFUL |

Manuelle Geräteverifikation (Flash-Export, Branding-Timing, UI-Labels) offen — auf SM-S911B oder gleichwertigem Gerät auszuführen.

### Block 9b — Video Type Selector UX Polish (2026-06-17)

**Geänderte Dateien:**

| Datei | Änderung |
|---|---|
| `ui/settings/SettingsComponents.kt` | `SameViewSegmentItem`: neues optionales Feld `icon: ImageVector? = null` (nach `testTag`, Default null — alle bestehenden Aufrufer unverändert); `SameViewSegmentControl`: Box-Inhalt verzweigt — wenn `icon != null`: Column mit Icon 24dp (dekorativ, `contentDescription = null`, `tint` = Segment-Farbe) + Spacer 4dp + Text labelLarge zentriert; wenn `icon == null`: bestehendes Text-only-Verhalten exakt unverändert |
| `ui/video/CreateVideoScreen.kt` | `modeItems`: Icons zu allen drei Modi ergänzt (`CompareArrows`, `Timeline`, `FlashOn`); Branding-Hint-`Text` entfernt |
| `values/strings.xml` | `create_video_branding_hint` Key entfernt |
| `values-de/strings.xml` | `create_video_branding_hint` Key entfernt |

**Neue Imports in SettingsComponents.kt:**
`size`, `Icon` (Material 3), `ImageVector`, `TextAlign`

**Neue Imports in CreateVideoScreen.kt:**
`Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.CompareArrows`, `Icons.Filled.Timeline`, `Icons.Filled.FlashOn`

**Icons (alle aus `material-icons-extended`, bereits Abhängigkeit):**
- Compare → `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.CompareArrows`
- Before & After → `Icons.Filled.Timeline`
- Flash → `Icons.Filled.FlashOn`

**Bekannte Einschränkung — Label-Umbruch:**

Mit `labelLarge` (14sp) und 1/3-Breite (≈91dp Textbereich auf 360dp Gerät) bricht "Before & After" weiterhin auf 2 Zeilen um. Das ist durch die Produkt-Entscheidung bewusst akzeptiert: die Schriftgröße wurde NICHT reduziert, um den Umbruch zu vermeiden. Der Icon als visuelles Anker-Element aller drei Segmente schafft Gleichgewicht, auch wenn "Before & After" mehr Texthöhe belegt als "Compare" und "Flash". Manuelle Verifikation bei Font Scale 1.3× und 1.5× erforderlich.

**Teststatus (2026-06-17):**

| Test | Status |
|---|---|
| `testDebugUnitTest` | PASSED |
| `assembleDebug` | BUILD SUCCESSFUL |
| `assembleRelease` | BUILD SUCCESSFUL |

Manuelle Verifikation offen: Portrait (360dp), Landscape, Font Scale 1.3×, Font Scale 1.5×.

### Responsive Layout System — Block 2: CompareLibrary Grid Scaling (2026-06-18)

Full specification: `RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT_SYSTEM_V1.md`

`RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT_SYSTEM_V1.md` is the authoritative specification for the responsive layout system of the SameView Android app. Block 1 of that document is the spec itself. Block 2 is the first implementation block and is now complete.

**Implemented:**

- `CompareLibraryScreen` uses `WindowWidthSizeClass` to determine grid column count:
  - Compact → 2 columns (previous fixed behavior, preserved as default)
  - Medium → 3 columns
  - Expanded → 4 columns
- `calculateWindowSizeClass(this)` is computed once in `MainActivity` inside the `setContent` composable scope
- `windowWidthSizeClass` is passed exclusively to `CompareLibraryScreen`; no other screen is affected
- `material3-window-size-class` artifact added as a BOM-managed dependency (alias `androidx-compose-material3-windowsizeclass`; alias `…-window-size-class` is a Gradle reserved name and was rejected)
- `@OptIn(ExperimentalMaterial3WindowSizeClassApi::class)` applied to `MainActivity.onCreate`, `CompareLibraryScreen`, and `CompareLibraryScreenTest`

**Not changed:** CameraScreen, CompareScreen, EditSessionScreen, CreateVideoScreen, SettingsScreen, AboutScreen, CameraViewModel, SessionScanner, SessionStorage, Backup/Delete logic, Navigation graph structure, Manifest, Permissions, Strings, metadata.json, Video Export pipeline.

**Verified test state (Block 2 — Completed 2026-06-18):**

| Test | Status |
|---|---|
| `assembleDebug` | BUILD SUCCESSFUL |
| `testDebugUnitTest` | BUILD SUCCESSFUL |
| `CompareLibraryScreenTest` (40 tests) | 40/40 PASSED on SM-S911B (Android 16) |
| `connectedDebugAndroidTest` (511 tests) | 511/511 PASSED on SM-S911B (Android 16) |

No open Block 2 tasks remain.

### Responsive Layout System — Block 3A: Max-Width Constraints (2026-06-18)

Full specification: `RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT_SYSTEM_V1.md` (see addendum for Block 3A/3B split)

**Implemented:**

- `SettingsScreen` and `CreateVideoScreen` (Configuring state only) receive a centered max-width container on `WindowWidthSizeClass.Expanded`:
  - Max content width: **680 dp**, centered horizontally
  - Compact and Medium: current behavior unchanged
- `windowWidthSizeClass` is passed from `MainActivity` to both screens; the value is already computed by `calculateWindowSizeClass(this)` since Block 2
- `AboutScreen`: no change; already has `widthIn(max=520.dp)` and is fully responsive per `ABOUT_SCREEN.md §10`
- `EditSessionScreen`: intentionally deferred to **Block 3B** due to `Scaffold.bottomBar` Save button requiring separate `navigationBarsPadding()` / `imePadding()` handling

**Not changed:** CameraScreen, CompareScreen, CompareLibraryScreen, EditSessionScreen, Video Export Pipeline, `SettingsComponents.kt`, `SettingsViewModel`, `SettingsRepository`, DataStore, Permission flows, Session Storage, Backup/Delete logic, Manifest, Permissions, Strings, metadata.json, rendering pipeline.

**Verified test state (Block 3A — Completed 2026-06-18):**

| Test | Status |
|---|---|
| `assembleDebug` | BUILD SUCCESSFUL |
| `testDebugUnitTest` | BUILD SUCCESSFUL |
| `SettingsScreenTest` (20 tests) | 20/20 PASSED on SM-S911B (Android 16) |
| `connectedDebugAndroidTest` (511 tests) | 511/511 PASSED on SM-S911B (Android 16) |

No open Block 3A tasks remain.

### Responsive Layout System — Block 3B: EditSessionScreen Max-Width (2026-06-18)

Full specification: `RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT_SYSTEM_V1.md` (see addendum A4)

**Implemented:**

- `EditSessionScreen` receives a centered max-width container on `WindowWidthSizeClass.Expanded`:
  - Max content width: **680 dp**, centered horizontally
  - Compact and Medium: current behavior unchanged
- Save button (in `Scaffold.bottomBar`) is visually constrained to the same 680 dp width as the form content on Expanded
- `navigationBarsPadding()` and `imePadding()` remain on the outermost `fillMaxWidth()` bottomBar container; only the visual inner container is constrained — Scaffold bottomBar height measurement and keyboard-above behavior are unaffected

**Not changed:** `EditSessionViewModel`, `SessionStorage`, `SessionScanner`, `metadata.json`, Save/Discard/Saving-in-progress dialog logic, reference date validation, field pre-population, `BackHandler`, image thumbnail display, navigation contracts, Manifest, Permissions, Strings.

**Verified test state (Block 3B — Completed 2026-06-18):**

### Responsive Layout System — Block 4: CompareScreen Max-Width (2026-06-18)

Full specification: `RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT_SYSTEM_V1.md` (see addendum A5)

**Implemented:**

- `CompareScreen` receives a centered 900 dp max-width container on `WindowWidthSizeClass.Expanded`:
  - A `Box(fillMaxWidth, weight(1f), contentAlignment=TopCenter)` replaces the direct Column children; inside it, a `Column(widthIn(max=900.dp), fillMaxHeight)` encloses both `CompareMetadataHeader` and the compare viewport (portrait and landscape branches)
  - On Compact and Medium: current behavior unchanged — inner `Column` uses `fillMaxWidth()`
- `TopAppBar` (custom `Row`) remains full-width outside the container; it is a direct Column child before the wrapper `Box`
- Fullscreen mode: `TopAppBar` and `CompareMetadataHeader` are hidden as before; the 900 dp container remains active for the compare viewport
- `windowWidthSizeClass: WindowWidthSizeClass = WindowWidthSizeClass.Compact` parameter added to `CompareScreen`; default `Compact` preserves all existing test call sites without change
- `windowWidthSizeClass = windowSizeClass.widthSizeClass` wired in `MainActivity` at the `CompareScreen` call site
- `@OptIn(ExperimentalMaterial3WindowSizeClassApi::class)` added to `CompareScreen` and `CompareScreenTest`

**Not changed:** Compare rendering, `ContentScale`, `computeFitBounds`, slider, divider, handle, labels, edge-hiding logic, `isLandscape` branching, `CompareMetadataHeader` internal structure, §42 maxLines / smart-reduction, `PortraitLocationRow` / `BoxWithConstraints` text-measurement, session data, navigation, `CameraViewModel`, `SessionStorage`, `SessionScanner`, Manifest, Permissions, Strings, Gradle.

### Responsive Layout System — Block 5: CreateVideoScreen Preview State (2026-06-18)

Full specification: `RESPONSIVE_LAYOUT_SYSTEM_V1.md` (see addendum A6); `VIDEO_EXPORT_V1.md §7.5` (see Expanded layout note)

**Implemented:**

- `PreviewContent` in `CreateVideoScreen` receives a centered 800 dp max-width container on `WindowWidthSizeClass.Expanded`:
  - A `Box(fillMaxWidth, weight(1f), contentAlignment=TopCenter)` wraps an inner `Column(widthIn(max=800.dp), fillMaxHeight)` that encloses both the `AndroidView`(PlayerView) and the actions `Column` (Share / Done / Delete Video)
  - On Compact and Medium: current behavior unchanged — inner `Column` uses `fillMaxWidth()`
- `PlayerView` and all three action buttons share the same 800 dp container — no separate widths
- `TopAppBar` remains full-width (Material3 standard behavior, outside the container)
- `navigationBarsPadding()` on the actions `Column` continues to work correctly inside the constrained container
- `windowWidthSizeClass: WindowWidthSizeClass = WindowWidthSizeClass.Compact` parameter added to `PreviewContent`; forwarded from `CreateVideoScreen` call site
- `import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxHeight` added (only new import)

**Not changed:** ExoPlayer creation, `PlayerView` configuration, playback, `repeatMode`, `volume`, `DisposableEffect` (player release), Share intent, Done navigation, Delete dialog and delete logic, `CreateVideoViewModel`, state machine, `RenderingContent`, `ConfiguringContent`, `VideoLoadingPreview`, `VideoModePreview`, export pipeline, navigation, strings, Manifest, Permissions, Gradle.

**Verified test state (Block 5 — Completed 2026-06-18):**

| Test | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `assembleDebug` | BUILD SUCCESSFUL |
| `testDebugUnitTest` | BUILD SUCCESSFUL |
| `connectedDebugAndroidTest` (full suite) | One unrelated `CameraControlsOverlayTest` failure: `No compose hierarchies found in the app` — pre-existing Compose hierarchy flake; isolated rerun PASSED; not a Block 5 regression |

No open Block 5 tasks remain.

### Session Branding V1 — Blocks 0–4 (2026-07-XX)

Full specification: `SESSION_BRANDING_V1.md`
Implementation plan: `implementation_plans/historic/SESSION_BRANDING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Block 0 — Metadata v6 Foundation:** `SessionBranding`, `SessionBrandingMeta` data classes; `METADATA_VERSION` bumped to 6; `SUPPORTED_VERSIONS` extended to include 6; v6 scanner validation for `files.brandingHandle`; `ScannedSession.branding: SessionBranding?`. 684/684 unit tests, 647/647 instrumentation tests.

**Block 1 — Image Assets + Normalizer:** 6 custom VectorDrawables; `BrandingNormalizer` (Bitmap → 512×512 RGBA PNG, metadata-clean by construction); `BuiltinBrandingSymbol` enum; `BuiltinSymbolRenderer`. 10/10 + 9/9 instrumentation tests.

**Block 2 — GlobalBrandingRepository:** File-based global branding at `filesDir/branding/handle.png` + `handle-meta.json`. `hasBranding()` requires both files present and meta parseable. Atomicity via `Files.move(REPLACE_EXISTING)`.

**Architecture note (Block 2→4 change):** `GlobalBrandingRepository.setBranding()` and `removeBranding()` are suspend but perform **no internal IO dispatching**. The caller is responsible for dispatching to an IO context. Changed in Block 4 for JVM testability. Threading contract documented in `GlobalBrandingRepository` KDoc.

**Block 3 — Session Branding Storage:** `SessionStorage` extended with `updateSessionBranding()`, `removeSessionBranding()`, `copyGlobalBrandingToSession()`; `saveSession()` auto-copies global branding on session creation (fail-soft). 20/20 instrumentation tests.

**Block 4 — Global Settings Branding UI:** `SettingsModule` provides `GlobalBrandingRepository` as Hilt singleton; `SettingsViewModel` injected with repository + branding functions; `SettingsScreen` shows "Default branding for new sessions" card. `BuiltinSymbolPickerDialog` is `internal` for reuse. 689/689 unit tests, 35/35 `SettingsScreenTest`.

**Block 5 — Edit Session Branding Card:** `EditSessionViewModel` extended with `GlobalBrandingRepository` injection, `hasBranding`/`hasGlobalBranding` StateFlows, `brandingError` SharedFlow (separate from `events` to avoid `MainActivity` interference), and four immediate-write branding functions: `onImageUriSelectedForBranding()`, `onSetSessionBrandingFromSymbol()`, `onRemoveSessionBranding()`, `onCopyFromGlobalBranding()`. Branding changes do NOT set `isDirty` and are NOT reverted by "Discard changes". New Branding card added between Current photo card and Location card in `EditSessionScreen`. Productional rule enforced: no Global-Branding fallback after removal. 696/696 unit tests, 36/36 `EditSessionScreenTest` on SM-S911B (Android 16).

**Block 6 — Share Comparison Image Integration:** New `BrandingHandleRenderer` (`internal object`, `branding` package, no Compose dependencies, reusable for future Video Export). `ShareRenderConfig` extended with `useBranding: Boolean = false`. `SliderRenderStrategy` receives `brandingBitmap: Bitmap? = null`; standard handle extracted to `drawStandardHandle()`; branding path calls `BrandingHandleRenderer.draw()` at 1.5× standard diameter. `ShareImageRenderer` decodes `branding-handle.png` from `sessionDir` (never from global branding). `ShareComparisonViewModel` gains `hasBranding`/`useBranding` StateFlows, injectable `brandingFileChecker`, `onToggleUseBranding()`. "Use branding" toggle placed in Style card between segment control and preview (Option B: toggle always active; Side-by-side shows informational note). `ShareComparisonPreview` renders branding handle via `AsyncImage` + Compose DrawScope (matching export semantics). 709/709 unit tests, 12/12 `ShareComparisonScreenTest`, 11/11 `ShareImageRendererInstrumentedTest` (includes I-12 pixel-difference test) on SM-S911B.

**Block 7 — Final Verification:** `assembleRelease` BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Full `connectedDebugAndroidTest` 711/711 PASSED on SM-S911B (Android 16) — 0 failures, 0 regressions. TODO comment `// TODO VIDEO_BRANDING: Check sessionDir for branding-handle.png...` added to `CompareSliderRenderEngine.kt` per `SESSION_BRANDING_V1.md §16`. I-12 pixel-difference test implemented and verified.

**Block 8 — Documentation Updates:** `SESSION_METADATA_V1.md` §5.3 + §6.5 + §6.7 updated to v6. `SESSION_BACKUP_EXPORT_V1.md` §4.2 v6 structure added. `SESSION_METADATA_EDITOR_V1.md` §21 Branding card added. `SETTINGS_UX_V1.md` §5 + §11 updated. `SHARE_COMPARISON_IMAGE_V1.md` FD-17 extended + FD-18 added. `VIDEO_EXPORT_V1.md` §33 Future Compatibility added. `CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTION.md` Session Storage section updated to schema v6 and `SUPPORTED_VERSIONS` {2,3,4,5,6}. `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` Blocks 5–8 documented.

### Session Branding V2 — UX Rework, Blocks 1–5 (2026-07-XX)

Full UX specification: `SESSION_BRANDING_V2_UX_REWORK.md` (approved, final)
Implementation plan: `implementation_plans/historic/SESSION_BRANDING_V2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (approved, final)

Technical backend (storage, metadata v6, backup, normalization, rendering) is unchanged from V1. All V2 changes are UI-layer only.

**Block 1 — Settings layout and wording:** "Default branding for new sessions" card replaced by "Your logo" card. New section title, always-visible description, placeholder circle in empty state, renamed action labels ("Choose photo", "Use a symbol", "Remove logo"). `settings_logo_*` string keys added; deprecated `settings_branding_*` keys retained for Block 5 cleanup. 46/46 `SettingsScreenTest` PASSED on SM-S911B.

**Block 2 — Symbol BottomSheet migration:** `BuiltinSymbolPickerDialog` (AlertDialog) replaced by `BrandingSymbolPickerSheet` (ModalBottomSheet, package `ui.branding`). Symbol cells render 56 dp handle-style previews (SameViewAccent ring, #F5F7FA fill, symbol at 72%) — full-ring style consistent with `BrandingPreviewCircle`. Both callers (`SettingsScreen`, `EditSessionScreen`) migrated. `performScrollTo()` removed from sheet tests (ModalBottomSheet has no standard scroll parent). 6/6 `BrandingSymbolPickerSheetTest`, 46/46 `SettingsScreenTest`, 40/40 `EditSessionScreenTest` PASSED.

**Block 3 — Edit Session logo card redesign:** V1 asymmetric Branding card replaced by V2 symmetric Logo card. "Change branding" (image-only) removed. "Choose photo" and "Use a symbol" always visible in both empty and populated states — direct replacement without remove-first. "Copy from default branding" renamed "Use your default logo". Card title: "Logo". Always-visible description. Placeholder circle in empty state. Type label "Symbol: [Name]" for builtin; no label for photo logos (product decision). `EditSessionViewModel` extended with `sessionLogoType: StateFlow<String?>` and `sessionLogoBuiltinId: StateFlow<String?>`, updated after all four write paths. Fix: `sessionLogoBuiltinId` required local val capture before null-check in Compose lambda (Kotlin smart-cast limitation on StateFlow delegates). 54/54 `EditSessionScreenTest` PASSED; all unit tests green.

**Block 4 — Share Comparison logo card extraction:** V1 "Use branding" toggle inside Style card replaced by V2 "Logo on handle" `SettingsCard` between Style and Information cards. Card absent when Side-by-side selected (card removed entirely, no disabled state, no disclaimer). Toggle label renamed "Show logo". Empty state: placeholder circle + informational text + "Add one in Edit session." — no editing actions. Populated state: `BrandingPreviewCircle` at 40% alpha when toggle OFF. `sessionBrandingFile` derived in Screen from `sessionDir` (no ViewModel change). `ShareComparisonScreenStub` in tests fully replaced to match V2 structure. Two missing imports (`Alignment`, `Spacer`) fixed after initial compile. 16/16 `ShareComparisonScreenTest` PASSED.

**Block 5 — String cleanup and BuiltinSymbolPickerDialog removal:** `BuiltinSymbolPickerDialog` composable (56 lines) removed from `SettingsScreen.kt`. 11 now-unused imports removed (kept `AlertDialog` — still used by location permission rationale dialog). 16 deprecated string keys removed from `strings.xml` and `strings-de.xml` (7 `settings_branding_*` including `settings_branding_builtin_symbols_title`, 3 `share_comparison_branding_*`, 6 `edit_session_branding_*`). Test `logoCard_noSliderOnlyHint_visible()` updated to use hardcoded literal `"Only applied to slider style"` before string key removal. `assembleDebug` BUILD SUCCESSFUL — compile-time verification of zero remaining deprecated key references. Full `connectedDebugAndroidTest` 751/751 PASSED on SM-S911B (Android 16).

**V2 Final State — Test counts post-V2:** `testDebugUnitTest` all green. `connectedDebugAndroidTest` 751/751 PASSED. Net new instrumentation tests: +16 `BrandingSymbolPickerSheetTest` (new class), +38 `EditSessionScreenTest` (14 added + block updates), +4 `ShareComparisonScreenTest` (net new logo tests).

### Session Branding V2 — Logo Card UX Refinement (2026-06-26)

Three approved UX refinements applied to the Logo card in `ShareComparisonScreen`. No changes to persistence, export renderer, or SettingsScreen.

**Issue 1 — "Use default logo" meaningful visibility:**

`_isUsingGlobalDefault: MutableStateFlow<Boolean>` added to `ShareComparisonViewModel`. Tracks whether the current session logo originated from the global default and has not been replaced by a user action. The button is now visible only when `hasGlobalBranding && !isUsingGlobalDefault`.

Derivation analysis: pure metadata comparison works reliably for builtin symbols (`type = "builtin"` + `builtinId` match). Photo logos (`type = "image"`) have no stored content hash — metadata comparison is not sufficient. A dedicated StateFlow is the correct approach: it tracks operational intent rather than trying to infer it from file content. Metadata comparison is used as a best-effort initialiser when the session already has branding on screen open (covers the common builtin case when re-opening a previously branded session).

State transitions:

- `true`: auto-copy fires at init; `onUseDefaultLogo()` succeeds; session builtin meta matches global builtin meta at init.
- `false`: `onImageUriSelectedForBranding()` succeeds; `onSetSessionBrandingFromSymbol()` succeeds; `onRemoveSessionBranding()` succeeds; session meta is photo or mismatches global at init.

`ShareMetadataSnapshot` extended with `brandingMeta: SessionBrandingMeta? = null`. `readMetadata()` reads `metadata.json → branding` block to populate it. No new storage writes.

**Issue 2 — Logo replacement must not modify Show logo toggle:**

"Choose photo", "Use a symbol", and "Use default logo" now only set `_useBranding = true` when adding the **first** logo (transitioning from no-logo to has-logo state). When replacing an existing logo, the toggle is left unchanged. `wasEmpty = _previewBrandingBitmap.value == null` check applied before setting the new bitmap in all three write paths.

**Issue 4 — Preview row spacing:**

`Spacer(modifier = Modifier.width(16.dp))` added between the preview circle Box and the Show logo switch row Box in the populated Zone 1 of `ShareComparisonScreen`. Matches the empty-state spacer at 16 dp to account for the heavier visual weight of the switch widget.

**Files changed:** `ShareComparisonViewModel.kt`, `ShareComparisonScreen.kt`

**Tests — new unit tests in `ShareComparisonViewModelTest` (+19):** `isUsingGlobalDefault_false_initially`, `isUsingGlobalDefault_true_afterAutoCopy`, `isUsingGlobalDefault_true_whenExistingBuiltinMatchesGlobal`, `isUsingGlobalDefault_false_whenExistingBuiltinDiffersFromGlobal`, `isUsingGlobalDefault_false_afterPhotoSelected`, `isUsingGlobalDefault_false_afterSymbolSelected`, `isUsingGlobalDefault_true_afterUseDefault`, `isUsingGlobalDefault_false_afterRemove`, `choosePhoto_setsUseBrandingTrue_whenFirstLogoAdded`, `choosePhoto_doesNotModifyUseBranding_whenAlreadyEnabled`, `chooseSymbol_setsUseBrandingTrue_whenFirstLogoAdded`, `chooseSymbol_doesNotModifyUseBranding_whenAlreadyEnabled`, `useDefaultLogo_setsUseBrandingTrue_whenFirstLogoAdded`, `useDefaultLogo_doesNotModifyUseBranding_whenAlreadyEnabled`, `removeLogoAvailable_whenShowLogoOff`, plus 4 existing `brandingVersion` and `sessionBrandingChanged` tests that continue to cover the write paths (no changes needed).

**Tests — new instrumentation tests in `ShareComparisonScreenTest` (+8):** `useDefaultLogo_hidden_whenAlreadyUsingDefault`, `useDefaultLogo_visible_whenGlobalExistsAndSessionDiffers`, `useDefaultLogo_absent_inEmptyState_whenAlreadyUsingDefault`, `removeLogoStillAvailable_whenShowLogoOff`, `useDefaultLogo_hiddenImmediately_afterUseDefault`, `useDefaultLogo_visible_afterChoosingPhoto`, `useDefaultLogo_visible_afterChoosingSymbol`, `useDefaultLogo_visibility_updatesWithoutScreenReopen`.

**Existing tests updated:** `ShareComparisonScreenStub` — added `isUsingGlobalDefault: Boolean = false` parameter; button visibility changed from `hasGlobalBranding` to `hasGlobalBranding && !isUsingGlobalDefault`; 16 dp spacer added to populated Zone 1. `launch()` helper extended with `isUsingGlobalDefault: Boolean = false`. Pre-existing tests `logoCard_emptyState_useDefaultLogo_visible_whenGlobalExists` and `logoCard_populated_useDefaultLogo_visible_whenGlobalExists` continue to pass because `isUsingGlobalDefault` defaults to `false`.

**Test results (2026-06-26):**

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL; 740/740 PASSED (was 669; +71 net new `ShareComparisonViewModelTest`)
- `ShareComparisonScreenTest` (`connectedDebugAndroidTest`) — **36/36 PASSED** on SM-S911B (Android 16); was 16+4=20 after V2 Blocks 4–5; +16 net new tests in this session

**Issue 3 (no change):** `onRemoveSessionBranding()` behavior unchanged. "Remove logo" is always available when `hasBranding == true`, regardless of `useBranding`. Confirmed by `removeLogoAvailable_whenShowLogoOff` regression guard. Manual device verification still required for spacing (Issue 4) and for the live button visibility update (Issue 1 in the production ViewModel flow).

### Reference Marker Drag Loupe — V1 (2026-06-30)

Full specification: `REFERENCE_MARKER_DRAG_LOUPE_V1.md` (Rev 2)
Implementation plan: `implementation_plans/REFERENCE_MARKER_DRAG_LOUPE_V1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Files changed:**

- `app/src/main/java/com/isardomains/sameview/ui/camera/ReferenceMarkerOverlay.kt` — loupe constants, bitmap loading/recycling via `LaunchedEffect`, drag state pre-initialization, loupe Box with Canvas crop rendering
- `app/src/main/java/com/isardomains/sameview/ui/camera/CameraScreen.kt` — added `referenceUri = referenceUri` at `ReferenceMarkerOverlay` call site
- `app/src/androidTest/java/com/isardomains/sameview/ui/camera/ReferenceMarkersOverlayUITest.kt` — 9 new loupe tests + `setLoupeOverlayContent()` helper

**Key implementation decisions:**

- Loupe local state only: `isDragging`, `draggingMarkerNormalizedPos`, `loupeBitmap` are Compose snapshot state scoped to `ReferenceMarkerOverlay` — no ViewModel state, no persistence, no session/export impact
- `draggingMarkerNormalizedPos` is pre-initialized to `Pair(nearestMarker.normalizedX, nearestMarker.normalizedY)` before the inner drag loop starts, so the loupe appears immediately when the drag is classified; the gesture classification loop consumes the slop-qualifying move event and the inner loop starts with no queued events
- Bitmap loaded proactively on `LaunchedEffect(referenceUri)` on IO dispatcher using `inSampleSize` doubling to ≤ 1024 px max dimension; EXIF orientation applied once via `android.graphics.Matrix`; bitmap recycled on `LaunchedEffect(isEditModeActive)` when edit mode exits (OQ-3)
- `android.graphics.Canvas.drawBitmap(Bitmap, Rect, RectF, Paint?)` — integer `Rect` for src (no `(Bitmap, RectF, RectF, Paint?)` overload exists in Android Canvas)
- Loupe clamped inside viewport: default above marker (`markerScreen.y - radius - fingerOffset`), clamped to `[radius .. vH - radius - loupeDoneAreaPx]` × `[radius .. vW - radius]`; fallback below marker if above still overlaps
- 88 dp Done-area clearance matches spec §7; residual risk: unusual system bar insets on some devices could reduce the effective safe zone below this value

**Test implementation notes:**

- `performTouchInput { down(Offset(x,y)); moveTo(Offset(x,y)) }` then `waitForIdle()` classifies the drag; a second `performTouchInput { moveTo(Offset(x,y)) }` is needed to drive the inner drag loop (used in `loupe_doesNotModifyMarkerCoordinate`)
- Clamping tests compute marker screen position as `vH/2 + min(vW,vH) * (normY - 0.5)` — not `vH * normY` — because `SHOW_FULL_IMAGE` with a square image centers the image vertically in a tall viewport; using `vH * normY` places the DOWN event ~600 px away from the actual marker and `findNearestMarker` returns null
- Move deltas of 50 px reliably exceed the device's `viewConfiguration.touchSlop` (~8 dp × 3.5 density = 28 px on SM-S911B)

**Latest verified test state (2026-06-30):**

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `ReferenceMarkersOverlayUITest` focused run — **13/13 PASSED** on SM-S911B (Android 16): 4 pre-existing + 9 new loupe tests
- `connectedDebugAndroidTest` full suite — **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** (one run); one flaky failure in `SettingsScreenTest.brandingCard_removeLogo_visibleWhenBrandingSet` observed on second run — pre-existing flaky test unrelated to this feature (see prior notes on Samsung IS_PENDING/branding test flakiness)
- `assembleRelease` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL

**Manual validation still required:** visual loupe appearance, crop geometry at various zoom levels, edge-clamping on a physical device, Done-area clearance on real navigation bar insets.

### Reference Markers — Visible Image Rect Boundary Fix (2026-07-01)

Full specification: `ALIGNMENT_POINTS_V1.md` (Rev 9), `REFERENCE_MARKER_DRAG_LOUPE_V1.md` (Rev 3)
Implementation plan: `implementation_plans/REFERENCE_MARKER_DRAG_LOUPE_V1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Rev 2)

**Problem:** Three UI elements incorrectly used the full viewport as their boundary reference. The edit-mode border, empty-state hint, and drag loupe clamping all followed the viewport, not the visible reference-image rectangle. In SHOW_FULL_IMAGE mode with mismatched aspect ratios (letterboxing/pillarboxing), these elements extended into the empty letterbox zones.

**Fix:** All three elements now follow the **transformed visible reference-image rectangle** — the image rect after applying `displayMode`, `overlayScale`, `overlayOffsetX/Y`, image dimensions, and viewport dimensions, then clipped to the viewport.

**Files changed:**

- `app/src/main/java/com/isardomains/sameview/ui/camera/ReferenceMarkerOverlay.kt` — added `VisibleImageRect` data class and `computeVisibleImageRect()` helper; updated loupe clamping to image-rect-based (with per-axis viewport fallback when image rect < loupe diameter); updated empty-state hint from `fillMaxSize().Center` to `absoluteOffset` + `size` within image rect
- `app/src/main/java/com/isardomains/sameview/ui/camera/CameraScreen.kt` — replaced old `MarkerEditBorder` (fixed aspect ratio border) with new implementation using `onSizeChanged` + `computeVisibleImageRect` + `absoluteOffset`; added `import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.absoluteOffset`
- `app/src/androidTest/java/com/isardomains/sameview/ui/camera/ReferenceMarkersOverlayUITest.kt` — updated `setBorderContent`, `setOverlayContent`, `setLoupeOverlayContent` helpers with optional metadata/displayMode/offset/scale params; removed `isLandscape` param; added 5 new tests

**Key implementation decisions:**

- `computeVisibleImageRect()` uses identical `baseScale` formula as `normalizedToScreen()`: `max(vW/iW, vH/iH)` for COMPARE_WITH_PREVIEW, `min(vW/iW, vH/iH)` for SHOW_FULL_IMAGE — single source of truth
- Per-axis viewport fallback for loupe clamping: when `imageRectW < loupeDiameterPx` on an axis, fall back to viewport bounds on that axis (handles extreme zoom-out edge case)
- Done-area reservation remains viewport-bottom-relative: `minOf(clampBottom, vH - loupeDoneAreaPx)` — not image-rect-bottom-relative
- `MarkerEditBorder` uses `onSizeChanged` + `absoluteOffset` pattern (not Canvas) so `boundsInRoot` in tests reflects the actual image rect position for bound assertions
- Empty-state hint has a fallback to `fillMaxSize` center when `metadata == null` or viewport not yet measured

**5 new tests added:**

1. `border_framesVisibleImageRect_whenLetterboxed` — wide 2:1 image in SHOW_FULL_IMAGE; asserts border top > 0 and bottom < viewport height
2. `border_matchesViewport_whenImageFillsViewport` — square image in COMPARE_WITH_PREVIEW; asserts border equals viewport bounds (±2 px)
3. `hint_centeredInsideVisibleImageRect` — wide 2:1 image in SHOW_FULL_IMAGE; asserts hint text stays within computed image rect top/bottom
4. `loupe_clampedToVisibleImageRect` — 1000×1000 square image in SHOW_FULL_IMAGE portrait (letterboxed); drag near image top downward; asserts loupe top ≥ imageRectTop (not 0)
5. `loupe_fallsBackToViewport_whenImageRectSmallerThanLoupe` — overlayScale=0.05 (image rect ~54 px, far smaller than loupe diameter ~360 px); asserts loupe stays within viewport

**Latest verified test state (2026-07-01):**

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `ReferenceMarkersOverlayUITest` focused run — **18/18 PASSED** on SM-S911B (Android 16): 13 pre-existing + 5 new boundary-fix tests
- `connectedDebugAndroidTest` full suite — **802/802 PASSED** on SM-S911B (Android 16)
- `assembleRelease` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL

**Manual validation still required:** visual border alignment in SHOW_FULL_IMAGE letterboxed mode, empty-state hint position with mismatched aspect ratios, loupe clamping in pillarboxed layout on a physical device.

### Reference Markers — MarkerEditBorder Viewport-Coordinate Fix (2026-07-01)

**Problem:** `MarkerEditBorder` call site in `CameraScreen.kt` passed only `Modifier.align(Alignment.Center)` — no size constraint. Inside `MarkerEditBorder` the outer Box does `.fillMaxSize()`, so `onSizeChanged` measured the full CameraScreen inner container (not the constrained 9:16/16:9 marker viewport). Since `overlayOffsetX/Y` are normalized to the constrained viewport, `computeVisibleImageRect` received the wrong `viewportWidth/Height`, causing the translation (`translationX = overlayOffsetX * viewportWidth`) to use the wrong scale factor. The border was positioned and sized correctly only when both offsets were zero.

**Fix (single call site, `CameraScreen.kt`):** Changed the `MarkerEditBorder` call site modifier from `Modifier.align(Alignment.Center)` to the same orientation-conditional modifier used by `ReferenceMarkerOverlay`:

- Portrait: `Modifier.fillMaxWidth().aspectRatio(9f / 16f).align(Alignment.Center)`
- Landscape: `Modifier.fillMaxHeight().aspectRatio(16f / 9f).align(Alignment.Center)`

`computeVisibleImageRect`, `normalizedToScreen()`, and `screenToNormalized()` are unchanged.

**Files changed:**

- `app/src/main/java/com/isardomains/sameview/ui/camera/CameraScreen.kt` — call site modifier for `MarkerEditBorder` (Layer 2.7) now matches `ReferenceMarkerOverlay` viewport constraint
- `app/src/androidTest/java/com/isardomains/sameview/ui/camera/ReferenceMarkersOverlayUITest.kt` — `setBorderContent` helper now wraps `MarkerEditBorder` in the same constrained Box (tagged `test_viewport`); updated `border_framesVisibleImageRect_whenLetterboxed` (non-zero `overlayOffsetY`, tight position assertion using constrained viewport height); updated `border_matchesViewport_whenImageFillsViewport` (compares against `test_viewport` bounds, not root); added 3 new regression tests

**3 new tests:**

1. `border_neverExceedsViewport_whenImageLargerThanViewport` — large image in COMPARE_WITH_PREVIEW; border must not exceed constrained viewport bounds
2. `border_topAndBottom_correctForLandscapeImageWithNonZeroOffsetY` — 16:9 image in SHOW_FULL_IMAGE portrait with `overlayOffsetY = -0.1`; border top/bottom must match position computed from constrained viewport height
3. `border_recomputesCorrectly_inLandscapeViewport` — 16:9 image in COMPARE_WITH_PREVIEW in landscape 16:9 viewport; border must fill the landscape viewport end-to-end

**Latest verified test state (2026-07-01):**

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `ReferenceMarkersOverlayUITest` focused run — **21/21 PASSED** on SM-S911B (Android 16): 18 prior tests + 3 new viewport-coordinate-fix tests
- `connectedDebugAndroidTest` full suite — **805/805 PASSED** on SM-S911B (Android 16)
- `assembleRelease` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL

**Manual validation still required:** border alignment with non-zero overlay offset on a physical device (three screenshot cases: letterboxed portrait, pillarboxed landscape, COMPARE_WITH_PREVIEW with panned image).

### Guide Tips System — Blocks A–H complete (2026-07-06)

Full specification: `GUIDE_TIPS_UX_V1.md`
Implementation plan: `implementation_plans/GUIDE_TIPS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Completed blocks:** A (Tip Model Cleanup), B (Card Visual Redesign), C (Placement Algorithm Update), D (Camera Screen Integration), E (Compare Screen Integration), F (Library Screen Integration), G (GuideTipController Extension), H (Final Verification)

**Active tips:**

| Tip ID | Scope | Completion Event |
|---|---|---|
| REFERENCE | CAMERA | Successful reference image import (`CameraViewModel.onReferenceImageSelected`) |
| SHARE | COMPARE | Export dropdown opened (`showExportMenu = true`) |
| EDIT_SESSION | COMPARE | Navigation to Edit Session screen (`addOnDestinationChangedListener` in `MainActivity`) |
| OPEN_COMPARISON | LIBRARY | First session tile tap in `CompareLibraryScreen` (before navigation) |
| MULTI_SELECT | LIBRARY | Multi-select activated via long-press in `CompareLibraryScreen` |

**Prerequisite enforcement:** EDIT_SESSION does not appear until SHARE is marked seen. MULTI_SELECT does not appear until OPEN_COMPARISON is marked seen.

**Test stability note:** A race in `CompareGuideTipIntegrationTest` was stabilized by signal-relative synchronization — `guide_tip_host` is awaited before asserting on `guide_tip_card`. No production code was changed.

**Static verification (Block H — 2026-07-06):**

- Deleted Tip IDs (ALIGN, COMPARE, HISTORY, EXPORT, MARKER, GPS): 0 references in source — clean
- Deleted Anchor Keys (ALIGN_CONTROLS, COMPARE_ACTION, HISTORY_ACTION, EXPORT_ACTION, MARKER_ACTION, GPS_CHIP): 0 references in source — clean
- `CameraGuideTipIntegrationTest.kt`: 4 tests, all Reference-scoped; no COMPARE/MARKER/GPS tests — clean
- `LibraryGuideTipIntegrationTest.kt`: 7 tests confirmed in source
- `guide_tip_got_it`: present in `strings.xml`/`strings-de.xml` as a dead resource (0 code references, no compile impact); pending one-line cleanup in a future maintenance pass

**Latest verified test state (Block H closure — 2026-07-06):**

| Test | Status |
|---|---|

### DeinWackelbild Integration — Block 1 & Block 2 complete (2026-08-28)

Full specification: `deinwackelbild/DEINWACKELBILD_INTEGRATION_V1.md`
Implementation plan: `deinwackelbild/DEINWACKELBILD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V1.md`

**Block 1 completed** — Compare menu entry only: `CompareScreen`'s Export dropdown gained a divider and a third item ("Wackelbild erstellen" / `export_menu_create_wackelbild`, test tag `compare_screen_export_wackelbild_item`), wired to a new optional `onCreateWackelbild` callback parameter. No navigation destination existed yet at this point.

**Block 2 completed** — real destination and navigation wiring:

- `MainActivity.kt`: `ROUTE_WACKELBILD`/`ARG_WACKELBILD_SESSION_ID`/`ROUTE_WACKELBILD_WITH_ARGS` constants and `wackelbildRoute(sessionId)` builder, modeled exactly on the existing `shareComparisonRoute` pattern; `onCreateWackelbild` now navigates to `wackelbild/{sessionId}`.
- New `WackelbildScreen.kt`/`WackelbildViewModel.kt` in package `com.isardomains.sameview.ui.wackelbild`. The Hilt-backed `WackelbildScreen` is a thin wrapper delegating to an `internal` stateless `WackelbildScreenContent(referenceFile: File, onBack, windowWidthSizeClass)`, so instrumentation tests exercise the exact production UI without needing a Hilt-provided `SavedStateHandle`.
- `WackelbildViewModel` resolves only `sessionId` (from `SavedStateHandle`) and `referenceFile = File(context.filesDir, "sessions/$sessionId/reference.jpg")` — no `metadata.json` parsing, no persisted/derived aspect-ratio state.
- The local preview is sized from the **intrinsic dimensions of the successfully decoded `reference.jpg`** (via Coil's `AsyncImagePainter.state`), not from session metadata and not from a hardcoded fallback ratio; capped at a moderate maximum height so the preview never fills the whole screen, using the same behavioral (not code-shared) pattern as `ShareComparisonPreview`'s aspect-ratio-driven, height-capped sizing.
- `ContentScale.Fit` is used throughout — no additional crop is ever introduced beyond what is already baked into the persisted `reference.jpg`.
- A single local fallback state (`wackelbild_preview_fallback`) covers both a missing `reference.jpg` and a present-but-undecodable one, driven uniformly by Coil's `AsyncImagePainter.State.Error` (plus a defensive check that a `Success` state's intrinsic dimensions are actually positive). The fallback keeps the normal TopAppBar/Back available; it performs no file repair and no network request.
- Standard `Scaffold`/`TopAppBar`/Back shell, cloned from `ShareComparisonScreen`; `widthIn(max = 680.dp)` on Expanded, matching the existing responsive pattern.

**Not yet implemented (later blocks):** tilt/swipe interaction, date overlay, HQ print reconstruction, network/API handoff, Custom Tab, temp-file lifecycle. Opening the Wackelbild screen in Block 2 performs no network request — no networking dependency exists in the app yet.

**Verification:**

- `testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `assembleDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `pixel2Api29` Managed Device, `WackelbildScreenTest` (new, 12 tests) — see final Block 2 report for pass/fail detail
- No unrelated existing test was modified

**Block 3 completed** — local tilt/swipe interaction:

- `WackelbildViewModel` now also resolves `captureFile = File(context.filesDir, "sessions/$sessionId/capture.jpg")` and owns a `visibleImage: StateFlow<WackelbildImageSide>` (`REFERENCE`/`CAPTURE`, always starting at `REFERENCE`). The existing single local fallback (`wackelbild_preview_fallback`) now covers a missing/undecodable `reference.jpg` **or** `capture.jpg` uniformly — no degraded one-image mode.
- New `TiltProvider.kt`, a narrow duplicate of `CompassProvider` (`Sensor.TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR`, no runtime permission, identical display-rotation remap table), reading `orientationAngles[2]` (roll) instead of `orientationAngles[0]` (azimuth). `CompassProvider.kt` is unchanged.
- New `TiltHysteresisStateMachine.kt` — a pure, Android-independent state machine (`NEUTRAL`/`TOWARD_REFERENCE`/`TOWARD_CAPTURE`) with an angle-wrap-safe delta, a switch threshold, and a re-arm band, so ordinary hand jitter never causes repeated switching. Placeholder tuning constants (`THRESHOLD_DEGREES = 9f`, `REARM_DEGREES = 6f`) are explicitly marked `// TODO(real-device tuning)` and are not final.
- Neutral posture is calibrated by `WackelbildViewModel` (not `TiltProvider`) from the first sensor reading after `onScreenActive()`; it is cleared on `onScreenInactive()`/`onScreenLeft()` and recalibrated on every subsequent resume — always relative to current device posture, never persisted.
- Swipe/sensor arbitration follows the exact required rule: a manual swipe (or the accessibility toggle) sets the image immediately and arms `swipeOverrideActive`; the hysteresis machine keeps observing underneath but its output is ignored until an explicit `NEUTRAL` transition is observed (`neutralObservedSinceOverride`), and only the *next* threshold-crossing transition after that clears the override and hands control back to the sensor — `SWIPE -> neutral/re-arm observed -> new threshold crossing -> sensor resumes`. An unchanged tilt reading at swipe time can never undo the manual choice.
- Horizontal swipe is implemented in `WackelbildScreen.kt` on the preview region only, via `detectDragGestures` accumulating per-axis distance and only consuming/firing once a gesture is clearly horizontal past a small threshold; a clearly vertical or ambiguous gesture never toggles.
- The preview is now structurally outside the screen's vertical-scroll container (only the interaction-hint area below it scrolls), resolving swipe/scroll contention without any new axis-arbitration code, per the implementation plan's `ShareComparisonScreen`+`CompareScreen`-composition approach.
- Sensor-unavailable UX: `wackelbild_hint_tilt_title` ("Handy leicht neigen" / "Tilt your phone") when a sensor exists, `wackelbild_hint_swipe_title` ("Über das Bild wischen" / "Swipe over the image") otherwise, same `wackelbild_hint_subtitle` either way. No hardware/error message is ever shown.
- Accessibility: the preview region exposes a custom accessibility action (`wackelbild_accessibility_toggle_action`, reusing the existing `compare_label_reference`/`compare_label_capture` strings for the current-image announcement) so a screen-reader user can switch images without tilting or swiping. No new visible control was added.
- Lifecycle observation (`ON_RESUME`/`ON_PAUSE`/disposal) is owned entirely by the `WackelbildScreen`/`WackelbildScreenContent` composable layer via `DisposableEffect`+`LifecycleEventObserver`, calling `viewModel.onScreenActive()`/`onScreenInactive()`/`onScreenLeft()`. `WackelbildViewModel` has no dependency on `Lifecycle`/`LifecycleOwner`/`LifecycleEventObserver`.
- No `WackelbildPreview.kt` file was created — the preview composable lives inside `WackelbildScreen.kt` as originally scoped.
- No runtime permission was added; no date/HQ/network/order work was performed.

**Not yet implemented (later blocks):** date overlay, HQ print reconstruction, network/API handoff, Custom Tab, temp-file lifecycle.

**Verification:**

- `testDebugUnitTest` — new `TiltProviderTest`, `TiltHysteresisStateMachineTest`, `WackelbildViewModelTest` plus the full existing suite
- `compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin` — compiles against the extended `WackelbildScreenTest`
- `pixel2Api29` Managed Device, extended `WackelbildScreenTest`
- `assembleDebug`
- No unrelated existing test was modified; no unauthorized file was touched

**Real-device validation still required:** tilt "feel" (threshold/re-arm constants), left/right intuitiveness after real device rotation, and swipe/sensor arbitration timing have not been validated on physical hardware in this block — the placeholder constants above are not final.

**Block 4 completed** — Date overlay preview:

- `WackelbildViewModel` gained its first metadata read: a narrow `reference.date` / `capture.timestampMs`-only read of `metadata.json` (no title/location/branding/GPS/visibility/favorite), via an injectable `metadataReader` seam and `viewModelScope.launch(ioDispatcher)`, mirroring `ShareComparisonViewModel`'s `readMetadata`/`currentUiLocale` precedent (`context.resources.configuration.locales.get(0)`, never `Locale.getDefault()`). Missing/corrupt metadata or a throwing reader is caught and treated as "no date" — never a crash.
- New `DateBadgeFormatter.kt` — a small pure helper (no Android `Context`) reusing `CompareLabelLogic`'s length-based precision technique (4/≥7/≥10 → year / year+month / full date) without modifying that file. Reference precision is preserved exactly; Capture always formats as a full date from `capture.timestampMs`, with no time-of-day.
- `dateOverlayEnabled` (temporary `MutableStateFlow`, default `false`, no DataStore/SavedStateHandle/metadata write) and `isDateOverlayAvailable` (**Reference date only** — `capture.timestampMs` never gates availability, per the explicit review correction). Attempting to enable while unavailable is a no-op.
- If Capture's date is defensively unavailable while Reference is valid, the toggle stays enabled, the Reference badge still works, and Capture simply shows no badge — never an invented date.
- UI: the toggle row sits directly below the preview and above the interaction hint, inside the existing scrollable column, using the existing `SettingsSwitchRow` plus a local supporting-text `Text` (mirroring `ShareComparisonScreen`'s private `InfoToggleRow` shape, since `SettingsSwitchRow` has no `supportingText` parameter — `SettingsComponents.kt` itself was not modified).
- The date badge is a runtime-only Compose overlay anchored to the actual displayed image's bottom-right corner (the existing preview `Box` is already sized to the image's own intrinsic ratio, so no separate letterbox-aware geometry was needed). Fixed, non-tunable geometry: `6.dp` corner radius, `8.dp` horizontal / `4.dp` vertical internal padding, `8.dp` right/bottom image-edge margin, `MaterialTheme.typography.labelMedium`, `SameViewAppSurface` background, white text, no shadow/border/pill shape.
- The badge switches immediately with the existing Block-3 `visibleImage` state — no new visible-image state, no fade/crossfade/animation/haptic/sound.
- Accessibility: the badge has no separate semantics node (avoiding the Block-3 `mergeDescendants` pitfall); its text is instead appended to the existing preview `contentDescription` when the overlay is enabled.
- No persisted file is mutated — the badge exists only in Compose state. No HQ/print/transfer rendering was added; that belongs to a later block.
- Tests: new `DateBadgeFormatterTest` (pure JVM), additive `WackelbildViewModelTest` coverage (availability rules, defensive Capture handling, toggle default/on/off, non-interference with tilt/swipe/visible-image state, metadata-read-failure safety), additive `WackelbildScreenTest` coverage (toggle visibility/enablement/hint text, badge show/hide/switching, exact-text display, missing-Capture behavior). All existing Block 1–3 tests remain green and unmodified in behavior.

**Not yet implemented (later blocks):** HQ print reconstruction, date rendering into transfer JPEGs, network/API handoff, Custom Tab, temp-file lifecycle.

**Real-device validation still required for Block 4** (visual only): badge legibility/contrast on light and dark photos, corner-radius/padding at real density, bottom-right margin in Portrait vs. Landscape, instant switching with no flicker, and German/English date-format correctness.

**Block 5 completed** — Two-file HQ/fallback print renderer (`docs/deinwackelbild/DEINWACKELBILD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V1.md` as corrected by Gates 5B/5C):

- New package `image/wackelbild/`: `WackelbildDimensionResolver.kt` (pure common-resolution math), `WackelbildPrintRenderer.kt` (the two-file HQ/fallback pipeline plus the sequential `WackelbildPairSizeLoop`), `DateBadgeRenderer.kt` (bitmap-side date badge).
- New `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildTempFileManager.kt` — creation side only (`cacheDir/wackelbild/<operationId>/`, deterministic `image_one.jpg`/`image_two.jpg` handles). Full cleanup lifecycle (sweep-on-entry, cleanup on success/cancel/final-error, `onCleared()`) remains Block 6 scope, not implemented here.
- `ShareImageRenderer.kt`: exactly 3 `private fun` methods widened to `internal fun` — `decodeHqCapture`, `renderHqReference`, `decodeReferenceFallback`. Zero logic/signature/call-site change. `prepareHqCaptureForSbs` stays `private`, untouched — Wackelbild never crops Capture (see below).
- **Reference HQ:** reuses `ShareImageRenderer.renderHqReference()`/`ReferenceRenderer.render()` unchanged, at Wackelbild's own target dimensions. Genuine-scale math (`WackelbildDimensionResolver.resolve()`) derives the reference side's real ceiling from `ReferenceRenderer`'s own fill/fit + overlay-scale math, proven offset-independent (scale and translate are separate matrix operations in `ReferenceRenderer.render()`).
- **Capture HQ:** a direct, uncropped downsample of `capture-original.jpg` via `decodeHqCapture()` — never `prepareHqCaptureForSbs`'s center-crop-to-slot logic, since Wackelbild's target is always the full viewport ratio. Gated by a relative-ratio-error guard (`WackelbildDimensionResolver.isRatioWithinTolerance`) comparing `capture-original.jpg`'s actual EXIF-oriented ratio against the viewport ratio, since CameraX's `ViewPort` crop rectangle is configured but never actually applied to the captured bitmap (`ImageProxy.toBitmap()` ignores `cropRect`) — so ratio equality is a per-session guard, not an architectural guarantee. **(Block 5E correction, 2026-08-29):** the guard's tolerance is `WackelbildDimensionResolver.roundingToleranceFor(expectedW, expectedH) = 1f / min(expectedW, expectedH)`, a dynamic per-viewport bound representing at most one pixel of the integer truncation `CameraScreen.kt` already performs when deriving viewport dimensions (`size.width * 16 / 9`, `(w * 9f/16f).toInt()`) — the only proven legitimate source of ratio noise. A prior flat `CAPTURE_RATIO_TOLERANCE = 0.02f` (2%) wrongly accepted genuinely different source ratios such as `1920×1088` vs a `1920×1080` viewport (a real ~0.735% difference — no repository or Android-API evidence supports treating this as invisible codec/stream padding for a still JPEG), which would then be non-uniformly stretched by `ImageDecoder.setTargetSize`. That flat constant has been removed; it is no longer part of the production contract.
- **Common resolution:** `commonScale = min(captureScale, referenceScale, apiSideScale, apiMpScale)`, no `.coerceAtLeast(1f)` — a source may legitimately determine a sub-viewport output; API limits (16,000px side / 80MP) are upper bounds only, never Share Image's unrelated 3840px cap.
- **Sequential, badge-before-encode rendering:** each pair-level attempt renders/decodes one side's bitmap, draws the optional date badge into it (pre-formatted string only — `DateBadgeRenderer` never reads metadata/formats dates/touches dp-sp), compresses to a temp file, and recycles — fully sequentially, never holding both full-size output bitmaps at once. `File.length()` therefore always measures the true final (badge-included) visual output. Pair-level size loop: quality `[92, 85]`, dimension step `0.85f`, max 4 dimension levels × 2 quality = 8 attempts, both sides always regenerated together on any retry, never accepted/resized independently.
- **Date badge geometry:** output-image-short-edge-relative fractions derived from Block 4's shipped dp constants (6dp/8dp/4dp/8dp/12sp against a 360dp baseline) — no device-density mapping, identical proportions in Portrait/Landscape, deterministic at any output resolution.
- **Frozen-pair fallback:** always decodes and freshly re-encodes `reference.jpg`/`capture.jpg` (never a byte-copy — `capture.jpg` may carry GPS EXIF). Dimension/ratio handling is deterministic: identical dims used directly (Case A); different-but-compatible-ratio dims (within `roundingToleranceFor(referenceDims.first, referenceDims.second)` — same dynamic-tolerance concept as the Capture guard, anchored on `reference.jpg`'s dims since those are always the exact integer viewport) resolve to the weaker source's own no-upscale dimensions (Case B); incompatible ratios — including a genuine near-mismatch beyond rounding slack, e.g. an equivalent of `1080×1920` vs `1088×1920` — are a **hard failure** (`Failure(PERMANENT_NO_VALID_SOURCE)`) — no crop, no stretch, no letterbox is ever attempted (Case C).
- **Memory/OOM:** no arbitrary heap-MB cap. `OutOfMemoryError` at any HQ decode/render step routes to the fallback; an `OutOfMemoryError` in the fallback itself is a permanent preparation failure. Peak memory is bounded structurally (sequential single-bitmap discipline) rather than by an invented constant.
- **Result model:** `WackelbildPrintResult.Success(pair, usedFallback)` / `Failure(reason)`, `pair.referenceFile`/`pair.captureFile` — a successful fallback is never represented as a failure value. `WackelbildPrintFailureReason` currently has one member, `PERMANENT_NO_VALID_SOURCE`.
- **No legacy-session scope:** no v2-v4-specific code, fixtures, or tests anywhere in Block 5 — every fallback/eligibility test uses a current-release-shaped fixture with a deliberately broken/missing HQ source.
- **Privacy/immutability:** output is always a fresh `Bitmap.compress()` JPEG (no `ExifInterface` write call exists in the new code); instrumentation test asserts absence of GPS/DateTimeOriginal/DateTime/Make/Model/Software/Lens tags on both outputs (**Block 5E addition:** also `MakerNote`/`BodySerialNumber`/`LensSerialNumber`/`ImageUniqueID`/`CameraOwnerName`, all confirmed inspectable via `getAttribute()` against the project's actual `androidx.exifinterface:1.3.7` dependency), and before/after SHA-256 equality for `reference.jpg`/`capture.jpg`/`reference-original.jpg`/`capture-original.jpg`/`metadata.json`.

**Files created:** `image/wackelbild/WackelbildDimensionResolver.kt`, `image/wackelbild/WackelbildPrintRenderer.kt`, `image/wackelbild/DateBadgeRenderer.kt`, `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildTempFileManager.kt`, plus JVM tests `WackelbildDimensionResolverTest.kt`, `DateBadgeRendererTest.kt`, `WackelbildPairSizeLoopTest.kt`, `WackelbildTempFileManagerTest.kt`, and instrumentation test `WackelbildPrintRendererInstrumentedTest.kt`.

**Files modified:** `image/ShareImageRenderer.kt` (visibility widening only, as above).

**Not touched:** `WackelbildScreen.kt`, `WackelbildViewModel.kt`, `DateBadgeFormatter.kt`, strings, `MainActivity.kt`/navigation, `CompareScreen.kt`, `TiltProvider.kt`/`TiltHysteresisStateMachine.kt`/`CompassProvider.kt`, `SessionStorage.kt`, `CameraScreen.kt`/`CameraViewModel.kt`, `SliderRenderStrategy.kt`/`SideBySideRenderStrategy.kt`/`CaptionRenderer.kt`, Gradle files, `AndroidManifest.xml`, any network/API/partner-key/BuildConfig file, Custom Tabs, WorkManager/services.

**Not yet implemented (Block 6+):** temp-file cleanup lifecycle (sweep-on-entry, cleanup on upload success/cancel/final-error, `onCleared()`), network/API handoff, Custom Tab launch. Block 5's `WackelbildPrintRenderer` is not yet wired into `WackelbildViewModel` or any UI — it is a standalone, independently-tested component pending Block 6/11 integration.

**Real-device validation still required:** visual comparison of a rendered Wackelbild pair against the same session's `reference.jpg`/`capture.jpg`; date-badge relative size/position at real print resolution vs. the Block 4 preview; large-real-session memory/performance behavior; saturated/wide-gamut color-appearance spot-check. No real DeinWackelbild network call is required or possible in Block 5.

**Block 6 completed (corrected scope, Gate 6A, 2026-08-29)** — Disposable-cache cleanup infrastructure + orphan sweep. Gate 6A found the originally-scoped Block 6 (active-operation cancellation, `onCleared()` cleanup, cleanup on real success/cancel/final-error) presupposed a real preparation/upload operation that does not exist yet — no CTA, no caller of `WackelbildPrintRenderer`. Adding `operationJob`/`operationDir` fields with no production writer would be dormant scaffolding, so that portion is resequenced (not removed) to the block that introduces a real operation trigger:

- `WackelbildTempFileManager.kt` gained `deleteOperationDir(dir)` (recursive, idempotent, canonical-path containment-checked against `cacheDir/wackelbild/`, best-effort per file) and `sweepStaleOperationDirs()` (deletes every direct child of `cacheDir/wackelbild/` unconditionally — no age threshold, no `excluding` parameter). Both reject/no-op on anything outside the dedicated root, including the root itself and any `filesDir/sessions/`-shaped path. The class and `sweepStaleOperationDirs()` are `open` solely so JVM tests can count invocations via a delegating subclass, mirroring the existing `TiltProvider` test-fake convention.
- `WackelbildViewModel` now constructs a `WackelbildTempFileManager(context.cacheDir)` and, in `init`, launches a one-time `sweepStaleOperationDirs()` call via the existing overridable `ioDispatcher` seam — run once per fresh ViewModel instance (i.e. once per genuine Wackelbild screen entry), never on recomposition or `ON_RESUME`. No operation directory is created and no operation state is tracked; `WackelbildPrintRenderer`/`WackelbildDimensionResolver`/`DateBadgeRenderer` remain completely unreferenced by the ViewModel.
- **Deliberately deferred, not implemented:** `operationJob`, `operationDir`, `onCleared()` operation cancellation, `finally`/`NonCancellable` cleanup around real prepare/upload work, cleanup on upload success/cancel/final-error, and force-kill-during-active-operation validation. Hard process death recovers via next-entry sweep, not via a claimed `onCleared()`/`finally` guarantee — Android provides no such guarantee on process kill.
- No UI, navigation, string, renderer, sensor, session-storage, network, or manifest change of any kind.

**Files modified:** `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildTempFileManager.kt`, `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildViewModel.kt`, plus JVM tests `WackelbildTempFileManagerTest.kt` (7 new cleanup/sweep cases) and `WackelbildViewModelTest.kt` (3 new init-sweep cases).

**Not touched:** `WackelbildScreen.kt`, `WackelbildPrintRenderer.kt`, `WackelbildDimensionResolver.kt`, `DateBadgeRenderer.kt`, `DateBadgeFormatter.kt`, strings, `MainActivity.kt`/navigation, `CompareScreen.kt`, `TiltProvider.kt`/`TiltHysteresisStateMachine.kt`, `SessionStorage.kt`, Gradle files, `AndroidManifest.xml`, any network/API/partner-key file.

**Not yet implemented (first real-operation block):** `operationJob`/`operationDir` ownership, cancellation wiring, `onCleared()` operation cleanup, cleanup on upload success/cancel/final-error, and the corresponding real-device force-kill-during-active-operation validation — all deferred until a genuine preparation/upload trigger exists to own.

**Block 7 completed — raw network client + DTOs (2026-08-29).** First HTTP-client code in SameView, but **not** an internet-enabled build: no `INTERNET` permission, no ViewModel/UI wiring, no real key, no real request possible or attempted.

- `com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.12.0` added (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`, `app/build.gradle.kts`) — core module only, no Retrofit/Moshi/Gson/kotlinx.serialization/MockWebServer/logging-interceptor.
- New package `net/deinwackelbild/`: `DeinWackelbildDtos.kt` (`CreateHandoffRequest`/`CreateHandoffResponse`/`UploadResponse`/`DeinWackelbildErrorEnvelope`/`DeinWackelbildErrorData`/`DeinWackelbildSlot`/`DeinWackelbildResult`/`DeinWackelbildApiError`/`DeinWackelbildErrorClassification`, plus request-serialization/response-parsing/URL-validation/idempotency-key-validation functions), `DeinWackelbildApiClient.kt` (interface — no OkHttp type, stateless across handoffs, no retry/UUID-generation/stored-handoff-state), `OkHttpDeinWackelbildApiClient.kt` (concrete implementation).
- **Constructor injection only:** `OkHttpDeinWackelbildApiClient(callFactory: Call.Factory, partnerKey: String, baseUrl = ...)` — the client has zero knowledge of where `partnerKey` comes from; `local.properties`/env/`BuildConfig` wiring remains Block 9.
- **Wire contract:** create (`POST /partner-handoffs`, `X-DWB-Partner-Key` + `Idempotency-Key` headers, JSON body `partner`/`locale` only — no `external_reference`, no session identifier) and upload (`POST` to the exact server-returned `upload_url`, `X-DWB-Handoff-Token` header, no partner key, multipart `slot`/`file` fields, `image/jpeg`) match the confirmed pilot contract exactly (`DEINWACKELBILD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V1.md` §13/§14 post-Block-7B-sync).
- **Error classification (raw client layer only):** 13 values — the plan's original 10 (`RETRYABLE_NETWORK`, `RETRYABLE_SERVER`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `INVALID_REQUEST`, `EXPIRED_HANDOFF`, `INTEGRATION_UNAVAILABLE`, `FILE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_IMAGE`, `DIMENSION_MISMATCH`, `PERMANENT_LOCAL`) plus three added this block (`INCOMPLETE_HANDOFF` for `409`, `MALFORMED_RESPONSE` for unparseable/invalid response data, `UNEXPECTED_HTTP_STATUS` as a catch-all) — plan §14.1 updated to match. HTTP status is always the primary classification signal; a malformed *error* body never downgrades an already-known HTTP classification.
- **OkHttp configuration:** `retryOnConnectionFailure(false)` (Block 8 owns visible retry accounting), `followRedirects(false)`/`followSslRedirects(false)` (no endpoint in this contract ever requires one), `connectTimeout`/`writeTimeout`/`readTimeout` = 60s, `callTimeout` = 90s — one shared client sized for the largest (upload) request rather than two separate clients. No logging interceptor, no new logging of any kind.
- **Cancellation:** `Call.enqueue()` + `suspendCancellableCoroutine` + `invokeOnCancellation { call.cancel() }` — not blocking `execute()`, which would leave an in-flight call running after coroutine cancellation. A cancelled coroutine always propagates `CancellationException`, never a `DeinWackelbildResult.Failure`. Response bodies are always closed exactly once via `Response.use { }`.
- **Testability:** injectable `okhttp3.Call.Factory` only (not the full `OkHttpClient`); JVM tests use a small hand-written fake `Call`/`Call.Factory` — no `MockWebServer`, no socket of any kind.
- **Privacy:** no partner key/handoff token/upload URL/checkout URL/file path/response body ever appears in `DeinWackelbildApiError`; no `external_reference`, no session/comparison identifier in any request.

**Files created:** `net/deinwackelbild/DeinWackelbildDtos.kt`, `net/deinwackelbild/DeinWackelbildApiClient.kt`, `net/deinwackelbild/OkHttpDeinWackelbildApiClient.kt`, plus JVM tests `DeinWackelbildDtoParsingTest.kt` (22 tests) and `OkHttpDeinWackelbildApiClientTest.kt` (30 tests).

**Files modified:** `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, `app/build.gradle.kts` (OkHttp dependency only), `docs/deinwackelbild/DEINWACKELBILD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V1.md` (§14.1 error-classification sync for the three additive values).

**Not touched:** `AndroidManifest.xml`, `WackelbildViewModel.kt`, `WackelbildScreen.kt`, `WackelbildPrintRenderer.kt`, `WackelbildTempFileManager.kt`, any camera/session file, strings, `MainActivity.kt`/navigation, `BuildConfig`/`local.properties`, Custom Tabs, any Block-8 state-machine file.

**Not yet implemented (later blocks):** ViewModel/operation wiring, retries/backoff, idempotency-key generation, `operationJob`/state machine (Block 8); `BuildConfig`/`local.properties` key injection (Block 9); `INTERNET` permission and real integration activation (Block 10); Custom Tabs/CTA/UI (Block 11+). No real network request is possible or was attempted in Block 7.

**Block 8 completed — operation orchestration + retry/lifecycle (2026-08-29).** Composes Block 5 (renderer), Block 6 (temp-file cleanup), and Block 7 (raw API client) into one real, finite, cancellation-safe handoff operation. Still not internet-reachable: no `INTERNET` permission, no real partner key, no UI/CTA/Custom Tab.

- New `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildOperationState.kt`: `WackelbildOperationState` sealed interface (`Idle`, `Preparing`, `AwaitingFallbackConfirmation`, `CreatingHandoff`, `UploadingSlot(slot)`, `Ready(checkoutUrl, usedFallback)`, `Failed(failure)`) and `WackelbildOperationFailure`/`WackelbildOperationFailureCategory` (six categories: `PREPARATION_FAILED`, `NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE`, `SERVER_TEMPORARY`, `INTEGRATION_UNAVAILABLE`, `HANDOFF_FAILED`, `INVALID_LOCAL_OUTPUT`). No user-facing strings, no secrets, no handoff token/upload URL/server message anywhere in the model.
- New `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildHandoffOrchestrator.kt`: stateless across calls — every dependency and all operation-local state (idempotency key, handoff response data, generation/attempt counters) live in `execute()`'s own local variables, never as fields, so the class needs no ViewModel-test-seam override of its own.
- **Retry:** 3 attempts per stage (Create, upload-one, upload-two independently), delays 1s then 2s, using plain `kotlinx.coroutines.delay()` (virtual-time-controlled by `runTest` in tests, no custom sleeper). Retryable: `RETRYABLE_NETWORK`, `RETRYABLE_SERVER`, `RATE_LIMITED` (all share the same schedule — no `Retry-After` signal exists to base a different one on).
- **Restart:** `EXPIRED_HANDOFF` (HTTP 403/410) and `INCOMPLETE_HANDOFF` (HTTP 409) all trigger a full handoff restart — new Idempotency-Key, same operation directory and already-rendered files reused, no re-render, back to Create. 409 is treated the same as 403/410 because the raw error envelope carries no `uploaded_slots` data to safely target a specific slot. Max 3 handoff generations (original + 2 restarts); a restart-trigger on generation 3 terminates with `HANDOFF_FAILED`.
- **Maximum reachable HTTP request count: 27**, explicitly derived (3 generations × (Create 3 + upload-one 3 + upload-two 3)) and proven by `WackelbildHandoffOrchestratorTest.worstCaseSequence_reachesExactly27Requests_thenTerminates`, which scripts the exact worst-case sequence and asserts the count.
- **Fallback confirmation — no implicit approval:** `execute()`'s `awaitFallbackConfirmation: suspend () -> Unit` parameter has no default value; when the renderer reports `usedFallback = true`, the orchestrator emits `AwaitingFallbackConfirmation` and suspends there with zero API calls made until the caller's confirmation genuinely resolves. `WackelbildViewModel` bridges this with a `CompletableDeferred<Unit>` (`awaitFallbackConfirmation()`/`confirmFallbackAndContinue()`); cancelling the operation while paused there unblocks the suspended `await()` via ordinary structured-concurrency cancellation — no special-cased cancel path was needed.
- **Response semantic validation:** Create requires `status == "awaiting_files"`; upload-one requires `status == "awaiting_files"`, `uploadedSlots` contains `"one"`, `checkoutUrl == null`; upload-two requires `status == "ready"`, `uploadedSlots` contains both `"one"` and `"two"`, `checkoutUrl != null`. Any deviation is a terminal `HANDOFF_FAILED`, never a retry.
- **Slot mapping:** Reference → `DeinWackelbildSlot.ONE`, Capture → `DeinWackelbildSlot.TWO` (locked in Block 7B).
- **Cleanup:** the whole `execute()` body is wrapped in `try { ... } finally { withContext(NonCancellable) { tempFileManager.deleteOperationDir(operationDir) } }` — runs on success, terminal failure, or cancellation at any suspension point (render, fallback wait, retry delay, or an in-flight API call). On success, cleanup happens immediately after the slot-two response validates as ready, before `Ready` is ever exposed — never held through checkout. Repeated/idempotent deletion is safe (Block 6).
- **`WackelbildViewModel`:** gained `operationJob: Job?` (sole owner — no separate `operationDir` field, since the orchestrator owns its own directory's full lifecycle), `fallbackConfirmation: CompletableDeferred<Unit>?`, `operationState: StateFlow<WackelbildOperationState>`, `startOperation()` (single-active-operation guard: a no-op while `operationJob?.isActive == true`), `confirmFallbackAndContinue()`, `cancelOperation()` (cancels the job, resets state to `Idle` synchronously — cancellation is never represented as `Failed`), and `onCleared()` (cancels the active job; actual cleanup is the operation's own `finally`, not this method). `apiClient`/`renderPrintPair` are new overridable `private var` fields (matching the existing `tempFileManager`/`tiltProvider` test-seam convention) — production `apiClient` uses a deliberate inert `partnerKey = ""` placeholder (harmless: no `INTERNET` permission exists yet, so no request built with it can ever reach the network) pending Block 9's real key wiring.
- **Hard process death** remains covered only by Block 6's next-entry sweep — neither `onCleared()` nor any `finally` is guaranteed to run to completion on a hard kill; this block does not claim otherwise.

**Files created:** `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildOperationState.kt`, `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildHandoffOrchestrator.kt`, plus JVM tests `WackelbildHandoffOrchestratorTest.kt` (31 tests) and additive `WackelbildViewModelTest.kt` coverage (8 new tests).

**Files modified:** `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildViewModel.kt` (additive fields/methods only, per above).

**Not touched:** `WackelbildScreen.kt`, `WackelbildPrintRenderer.kt`/`WackelbildDimensionResolver.kt`/`DateBadgeRenderer.kt`, `WackelbildTempFileManager.kt`, `net/deinwackelbild/*` client/DTO files, strings, `MainActivity.kt`/navigation, `BuildConfig`, `local.properties`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, Gradle files, Custom Tabs.

**Not yet implemented (later blocks):** real partner-key injection (Block 9); `INTERNET` permission and real integration activation (Block 10); CTA/consent UI, Custom Tab launch (Block 11+); real pilot-server validation (after Block 10 activation). No real network request is possible or was attempted in Block 8.

**Block 9 completed — partner-key provisioning (2026-09-03).** Wires `BuildConfig.DEINWACKELBILD_PARTNER_KEY` with a build-type-gated source-resolution policy and a local blank-key rejection guard. Still not internet-reachable: no `INTERNET` permission, no CTA/UI/Custom Tab.

- **`app/build.gradle.kts`:** reads `local.properties` once via `Properties()`; `defaultConfig.buildConfigField` resolves `local.properties → environment variable → ""` (debug/non-release policy); `buildTypes.release.buildConfigField` overrides the same field with `environment variable only → ""` — the release expression contains no reference to the local-properties-derived value, so a developer's local pilot/test key cannot reach a release build regardless of its presence in `local.properties`. AGP's per-buildType override is authoritative over `defaultConfig` for the same field name. A small local `escapeForBuildConfigStringLiteral()` helper (backslash → double-quote → `\n` → `\r`, no dependency) escapes the value before interpolation into the generated string literal.
- **`OkHttpDeinWackelbildApiClient.createHandoff()`:** gained a `partnerKey.isBlank()` precheck, alongside the existing idempotency-key precheck, returning `DeinWackelbildResult.Failure(DeinWackelbildApiError(DeinWackelbildErrorClassification.INTEGRATION_UNAVAILABLE))` before `Request.Builder()`/`callFactory.newCall(...)` — zero network calls on a blank key. No prefix/length validation, no logging, no exception, no startup blocking.
- **`WackelbildViewModel`:** the Block 8 placeholder `partnerKey = ""` is replaced with `partnerKey = BuildConfig.DEINWACKELBILD_PARTNER_KEY`. No other change to operation state, retry, idempotency, rendering, cleanup, sensors, swipe, lifecycle, UI, or navigation.
- **Tests:** `OkHttpDeinWackelbildApiClientTest.kt` gained `createHandoff_blankPartnerKey_integrationUnavailable_noRequestMade`, mirroring the existing `createHandoff_invalidIdempotencyKey_noRequestMade` pattern (fake `Call.Factory` that records whether it was invoked). All existing tests, including the fake-nonblank-key and partner-key-privacy tests, remain unmodified and green.
- **No real key anywhere:** `local.properties` was never read, printed, or modified during implementation or verification — only its git-ignored/untracked status was relevant. Verification used `assembleDebug`/`assembleRelease` plus one synthetic-environment-variable release build (`DEINWACKELBILD_PARTNER_KEY=synthetic_release_value_9b`) to prove the env-var path; the generated `BuildConfig` was checked only for blank-vs-non-blank / equality-with-the-known-synthetic-value, never printed.

**Files modified:** `app/build.gradle.kts`, `net/deinwackelbild/OkHttpDeinWackelbildApiClient.kt`, `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildViewModel.kt`, `net/deinwackelbild/OkHttpDeinWackelbildApiClientTest.kt`.

**Not touched:** `AndroidManifest.xml`, strings, `WackelbildScreen.kt`, `WackelbildViewModelTest.kt`, `WackelbildHandoffOrchestrator.kt`, `WackelbildPrintRenderer.kt`, `WackelbildTempFileManager.kt`, `MainActivity.kt`/navigation, camera/session code, CI configuration. No `PARTNER_KEY_SETUP.md` or other new documentation file was created.

**Not yet implemented (later blocks):** `INTERNET` permission and real integration activation (Block 10); CTA/consent UI, Custom Tab launch (Block 11+); real pilot-server validation (after Block 10 activation). No real network request is possible or was attempted in Block 9.

**Block 10 completed — manifest/dependency/Custom Tab infrastructure (2026-09-03).** Adds the app's network-capability surface and Custom Tab launch infrastructure. Still not user-activatable: no CTA, no consent dialog, no `startOperation()`/`confirmFallbackAndContinue()`/launcher caller anywhere in production code.

- **`AndroidManifest.xml`:** added `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />`, grouped with the existing `<uses-permission>` declarations. No other manifest change — no `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` (already present transitively via `androidx.media3:media3-common:1.5.1`, unrelated to this feature), no `networkSecurityConfig`, no `usesCleartextTraffic` override (minSdk 29 already defaults cleartext to disabled), no new exported component, no `<queries>` entry, no deep link.
- **`gradle/libs.versions.toml` / `app/build.gradle.kts`:** added `androidx.browser:browser:1.10.0` (current stable per Google Maven metadata at implementation time, superseding the plan's original `1.9.0` placeholder) as a single `implementation(libs.androidx.browser)` line.
- **New `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildCustomTabLauncher.kt`:** `fun launch(context: Context, url: String): Boolean` — parses the given URL as-is via `Uri.parse`, opens it in a `CustomTabsIntent`, returns `true` on successful invocation, `false` only on `ActivityNotFoundException` (no broader catch). No HTTPS validation (already validated upstream), no logging, no WebView fallback, no persisted state. Not referenced from `WackelbildScreen.kt`, `WackelbildViewModel.kt`, `MainActivity.kt`, or any other production call site — wiring is Block 11's responsibility.
- **No dedicated launcher test:** intentional — no Robolectric exists in this repo, and the real launch outcome (successful Custom Tab open vs. `ActivityNotFoundException`) depends on whatever browser/Custom-Tab provider happens to be installed on the test device, which would make an instrumented test of the real OS call non-deterministic. Block 11 tests launch success/failure deterministically through a fake launcher seam at the ViewModel level instead.
- **Merged-manifest verification (both `assembleDebug`/`assembleRelease` variants):** `INTERNET` is present in both merged manifests, attributed to the app's own `AndroidManifest.xml` in the manifest-merger blame report; `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` remains attributed to `androidx.media3:media3-common:1.5.1`, unchanged; `androidx.browser:browser:1.10.0` contributes no permission, activity, service, provider, exported component, or `<queries>` entry of its own.
- **No ProGuard change:** `assembleRelease`/`bundleRelease` succeeded without any `app/proguard-rules.pro` modification.

**Files created:** `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildCustomTabLauncher.kt`.

**Files modified:** `AndroidManifest.xml`, `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, `app/build.gradle.kts`.

**Not touched:** `WackelbildScreen.kt`, `WackelbildViewModel.kt`, `WackelbildHandoffOrchestrator.kt`, `WackelbildPrintRenderer.kt`, `WackelbildTempFileManager.kt`, strings, `MainActivity.kt`/navigation, `net/deinwackelbild/*` API client/DTOs, `BuildConfig` partner-key wiring, camera/session code, `app/proguard-rules.pro`, `RELEASE_HARDENING_AUDIT_V2.md` (Block 14 owns its stale INTERNET claim), `CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTION.md`.

**Not yet implemented (later blocks):** CTA/consent dialog/spinner/fallback dialog/Back-confirmation, `startOperation()`/`confirmFallbackAndContinue()`/Custom Tab launch wiring, first real pilot network call (Block 11); error/cancellation polish against the real API (Block 12); release/privacy/documentation hardening including the `RELEASE_HARDENING_AUDIT_V2.md` correction (Block 14). No real network request is possible or was attempted in Block 10 — the app now merely has the *capability*; nothing in the current UI exercises it. Block 10 is not Play-release-ready: Google Play Data Safety review/update, Privacy Policy disclosure, and partner/commission disclosure review all remain open external items.

**Block 11 completed — end-to-end UI wiring + first-pilot readiness (2026-09-04).** Connects the existing Wackelbild UI to the real Block 8 operation and Block 10 Custom Tab launcher for the first time. The feature is now user-reachable, pending only a real pilot key/manual device run.

- **Consent model:** no separate initial consent dialog exists or is added — the persistent on-screen disclosure plus a single CTA tap (`Bestelle dein Wackelbild` / `Order your lenticular print`) is the entire consent mechanism (spec §10's explicit prohibition on an extra pre-transfer dialog). The CTA tap calls `viewModel.startOperation()` directly.
- **Busy presentation:** `Preparing`/`CreatingHandoff`/`UploadingSlot(ONE)`/`UploadingSlot(TWO)`/`AwaitingFallbackConfirmation` (while its own dialog is visible on top) all collapse into one spinner + `Wackelbild wird vorbereitet …` presentation — no phase name, slot, retry count, or percentage is ever exposed. CTA is hidden throughout; tilt/swipe preview interaction remains fully usable; date toggle is disabled from CTA-tap through `Ready`/return or `Failed` (spec §9.10).
- **Fallback confirmation:** separate `AlertDialog` shown only for `AwaitingFallbackConfirmation`, with the now-finalized exact copy ("Originalqualität nicht verfügbar" / "Original quality not available", full locked message, "Abbrechen"/"Trotzdem fortfahren"). Continue calls `confirmFallbackAndContinue()`; Cancel and system/app Back (while this dialog is showing) both call `cancelOperation()` — Back never additionally shows the generic cancel-transfer dialog on top.
- **Generic transfer-cancellation dialog:** shown on Back only during `Preparing`/`CreatingHandoff`/`UploadingSlot(*)` — exact locked copy; "Weiter übertragen" dismisses only the dialog, "Abbrechen" calls `cancelOperation()`. Pattern cloned from `CreateVideoScreen`'s identical `showCancelDialog`/`BackHandler`/`LaunchedEffect(state)` auto-dismiss precedent, including routing the TopAppBar back-icon's `onClick` through the same `handleBackPressed()` function as the system/gesture back button (not just `BackHandler` alone) so the icon can't bypass the confirmation.
- **Error-copy mapping:** `NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE`/`SERVER_TEMPORARY` show their approved text plus a dedicated "Erneut versuchen"/"Try again" button; `INTEGRATION_UNAVAILABLE`/`PREPARATION_FAILED`/`INVALID_LOCAL_OUTPUT`/`HANDOFF_FAILED` show their approved text and the normal CTA reappears as the retry mechanism (no separate retry button) — `HANDOFF_FAILED` deliberately reuses the identical `PREPARATION_FAILED` copy per explicit product decision. No HTTP code, server message, or "handoff" terminology ever reaches a string.
- **Custom Tab launch (new ViewModel state, `WackelbildOperationState.kt` itself unmodified):** `CustomTabAwaitState` enum, `isScreenForeground`/`pendingCheckoutUrl` bookkeeping added to the existing `onScreenActive()`/`onScreenInactive()` hooks (no new lifecycle observation), a buffered `Channel`-based `launchCustomTabEvent` (same convention as `ShareComparisonEvent`/`CreateVideoEvent`), and `customTabOpenFailure: StateFlow<String?>`. `Ready` reached while foregrounded sends the URL immediately; reached while backgrounded, it's deferred in `pendingCheckoutUrl` and sent the next time `onScreenActive()` fires — never launching a browser while SameView itself is backgrounded. The Screen (owns `Context`) collects the event via `LaunchedEffect`, calls the launcher, and reports the outcome back via `onCustomTabLaunchResult(url, success)`. Success resets `operationState` to `Idle` (no intermediate success screen) and arms `LAUNCHED_AWAITING_RETURN`; failure retains the URL in `customTabOpenFailure` for `retryOpenCheckoutUrl()` (same URL, no re-render, no new handoff, no re-upload). Browser return (`onScreenActive()` with the marker armed) resets the visible image to Reference, re-enables the date toggle implicitly (since `operationState` is already `Idle`), and clears the marker so a later unrelated resume is a no-op.
- **Testability seam:** `WackelbildScreenContent` gained `onLaunchCustomTab: (Context, String) -> Boolean = { ctx, url -> WackelbildCustomTabLauncher().launch(ctx, url) }` — a lambda, not a new interface — so instrumentation tests fake success/failure deterministically with zero real browser/network involvement.
- **Localization:** 19 new string keys added (EN + DE) — disclosure, CTA, busy copy, cancel-transfer dialog (4 strings), fallback dialog (4 strings, now fully locked including the message), 6 error/retry strings, 2 Custom-Tab-open-failure strings. No unresolved wording remains.
- **Tests:** `WackelbildViewModelTest.kt` gained 14 new tests (exactly-once launch foreground/background/deferred delivery, no-duplicate-on-recomposition, launch success/failure handling, same-URL retry-open with no re-render, browser-return reset behavior, ordinary-resume non-interference) — no existing Block 8 test modified. `WackelbildScreenTest.kt` gained 33 new tests covering CTA/consent, busy presentation, fallback dialog, generic cancellation dialog, all six failure-category copy mappings, Custom Tab launch/failure/retry-open, and layout/accessibility — all against a fake launcher, zero real browser or network traffic.

**Files modified (exactly the eight approved):** `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildViewModel.kt`, `ui/wackelbild/WackelbildScreen.kt`, `values/strings.xml`, `values-de/strings.xml`, `app/src/test/.../ui/wackelbild/WackelbildViewModelTest.kt`, `app/src/androidTest/.../ui/wackelbild/WackelbildScreenTest.kt`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` (this entry), `docs/deinwackelbild/DEINWACKELBILD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V1.md` (§14.3–§14.5 correction).

**Not touched:** `WackelbildCustomTabLauncher.kt`, `WackelbildHandoffOrchestrator.kt`, `WackelbildHandoffOrchestratorTest.kt`, `WackelbildOperationState.kt`, `WackelbildPrintRenderer.kt`, `WackelbildTempFileManager.kt`, `net/deinwackelbild/*` API client/DTOs, `BuildConfig` partner-key wiring, `MainActivity.kt`/navigation, `AndroidManifest.xml`, Gradle/version-catalog files, camera/session-storage code, `RELEASE_HARDENING_AUDIT_V2.md`, `CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTION.md`.

**Not yet implemented / remaining:** real-device manual pilot validation (portrait/landscape, date overlay on/off, real fallback path, full happy path against the real pilot endpoint with the real checkout Custom Tab, EXIF/GPS privacy spot-check, cancellation-during-transfer, temp-file cleanup, large-session performance); error/cancellation polish against the real API's actual observed behavior (Block 12); release/privacy/documentation hardening including the `RELEASE_HARDENING_AUDIT_V2.md` correction (Block 14). Block 11 is not Play-release-ready — Google Play Data Safety review/update, Privacy Policy disclosure, and partner/commission disclosure review all remain open external items.

**Handoff configuration + print-format-matched preview/rendering completed (2026-09-21).** The live partner create endpoint accepts optional top-level `format`, `orientation` and `direction`. SameView now selects one DeinWackelbild print format per session, shows exactly that centered crop in the Wackelbild preview before the order CTA, renders both transfer JPEGs with the identical crop, and hands off the matching `format` — so DeinWackelbild receives images that already have the selected aspect ratio. This supersedes the earlier narrow 3:4-only format mapping, which is removed.

- **Request fields:** `CreateHandoffRequest` has nullable `format`, `orientation`, `direction` (default `null`, serialized only when non-null, like `locale`). The response `configuration` object is not parsed.
- **Print target (`image/wackelbild/WackelbildPrintTarget.kt`, pure Kotlin):** `select(frameWidth, frameHeight)` picks the family with the smallest relative cover-crop loss `max(r, t) / min(r, t)` (`r = short / long`, strict `<`, fixed order as tie-break): 2:3 → `10x15`, A-series (10.5 / 14.9) → `a6`, 3:4 → `15x20`, 1:1 → `15x15`. It also exposes the orientation-aware `aspect`, the centered `cropRect(width, height)` (only the excess axis is cropped, made even; `null` when nothing to crop) and `matchesOutput(width, height)` (aspect within 2 px of rounding). Examples: 9:16 and 16:9 → `10x15` with a 1080×1920 → `(0, 150, 1080, 1620)` crop; 4:5 and 5:4 → `15x20`; square → `15x15`.
- **One target, once:** `WackelbildViewModel` resolves the target in `init` from `readSessionViewport(sessionDir)`, requiring `reference.jpg` and `capture.jpg` to match that viewport within one pixel (else no target), and exposes `printTargetState` (`Pending` → `Resolved(target?)`). `startOperation` awaits `Resolved` and passes the exact same target ViewModel → `WackelbildHandoffOrchestrator.execute(printTarget)` → `renderPrintPair(..., printTarget)` (the renderer lambda gained a 4th parameter). Nothing re-selects a family from rendered dimensions.
- **Preview:** with a target the preview box takes the target's aspect and both images use the same centered `ContentScale.Crop`; with no target it is unchanged (full frame, `Fit`). While `Pending` nothing is composed (no full-frame flash). Blend, tilt, ridges, perspective, gesture, semantics, date toggle and badge anchoring are unchanged.
- **Renderer:** `WackelbildPrintRenderer.renderPrintPair(..., target = null)` crops in `renderBadgeEncodeRecycle` — the single shared point for HQ and fallback and both sides — right after the bitmap is produced and before the badge is drawn, so the date is positioned against the final cropped output. Both sides use the same `dims`, hence the identical rectangle. The crop is a 1:1 `Canvas.drawBitmap` into a new mutable bitmap and the full frame is recycled immediately (transient peak ≈ 1 + the kept fraction of one frame). A bitmap that differs from `dims` throws `IOException` (HQ falls back, fallback fails). The size loop, dimension resolution, file-size limit, OOM handling and metadata stripping are unchanged; session files are never modified.
- **Transfer date margin:** the date badge embedded in the transfer JPEGs uses an edge margin of `12/360` of the short edge (`DateBadgeRenderer.EDGE_MARGIN_FRACTION`, previously `8/360`), the same for right and bottom and for portrait and landscape; the live preview badge stays at `8.dp`. The reason is DeinWackelbild.de's own inner display/print inset and crop (observed ≈10 px, ≈1% per side), which left the smaller margin visibly too tight. Style, text, size, padding and corner radius are unchanged. Still to validate by hand: one portrait and one landscape session with the date on, checking the badge clears the partner's inset without looking detached from the corner.
- **Handoff:** `format = target.slug` (omitted without a target), `orientation` from the rendered dimensions (omitted for a square), `direction = horizontal`. With a target the rendered pair must be readable, identical and `matchesOutput`; otherwise the operation fails locally with `PREPARATION_FAILED` before the fallback dialog and before any network call. The request is built once and reused across handoff restarts. There is no retry without `format`.
- **Failure/null behavior:** unknown or untrusted session geometry → no target → full-frame preview/transfer and no `format`. A partner rejection of a slug is the existing non-retryable failure.
- **Tests:** JVM — new `WackelbildPrintTargetTest` (family mapping, exact boundaries, monotonic order, aspect, crop rectangles, output check), target-driven `WackelbildHandoffOrchestratorTest` configuration tests, and `WackelbildViewModelTest` target-flow tests. Instrumented — new `WackelbildPrintRendererInstrumentedTest` cases (HQ and fallback crop for 9:16 and 16:9 on both sides, identical pair dimensions, no crop for an already-matching or absent target, date inside the cropped output, sources unchanged, no EXIF) and `WackelbildScreenTest` cases (target aspect, pixel-checked centered crop, null-target full frame, `Pending` → `Resolved` without a flash, badge inside the target box, swipe/ridges unchanged). Two existing-test synchronization adjustments, assertions unchanged: `cancellation_duringRetryDelay_cleanupRuns_onlyOneAttemptMade` awaits a `createAttempted` signal, and the `WackelbildViewModelTest` operation tests use `advanceUntilOperationSettles`, because the orchestrator reads the rendered dimensions on the real `Dispatchers.IO` — a thread hop the test scheduler cannot advance.
- **Docs:** integration spec §3.5, §7, §9.3, §9.6, §16.1, §16.2, §17 (+ new §17.1), §20, §32, §44, §48-4, §56; plan §6.4, §8.3, §9.2, §9.3 note, new §9.6, §9.5 statements, §14.1, §21.
- **Remaining:** real-device visual validation — a 9:16 portrait and a 16:9 landscape session must show the 2:3 / 3:2 crop with the date inside, and the partner must open `10x15` with the matching orientation and "Seitlich kippen" and an unchanged composition (a 3:4 session → `15x20`; a session without viewport metadata → full frame). Known risks: the partner's fixed inner-preview inset leaves a ~1% per-side cover-crop even at an exact ratio match, against the date margin of 2.2% of the short edge; a transient bitmap-memory peak while cropping; a retired or renamed partner slug fails the order outright.
